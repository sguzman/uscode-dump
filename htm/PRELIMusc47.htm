Committee Members and Committee Advisors may consider any submissions by the Committee Advisors (e.g., a countervailing risk assessment), as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) If the Committee Members and Committee Advisors are unable to reach consensus through the foregoing process, the Committee Members identified in subsection 3(b) of this order shall determine a recommendation by majority vote.

<p class="statutory-body">The member of the Commission designated by the President as chairman shall be the chief executive officer of the Commission. It shall be his duty to preside at all meetings and sessions of the Commission, to represent the Commission in all matters relating to legislation and legislative reports, except that any commissioner may present his own or minority views or supplemental reports, to represent the Commission in all matters requiring conferences or communications with other governmental officers, departments or agencies, and generally to coordinate and organize the work of the Commission in such manner as to promote prompt and efficient disposition of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission. In the case of a vacancy in the office of the chairman of the Commission, or the absence or inability of the chairman to serve, the Commission may temporarily designate one of its members to act as chairman until the cause or circumstance requiring such designation shall have been eliminated or corrected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Organization of staff</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From time to time as the Commission may find necessary, the Commission shall organize its staff into (1) integrated bureaus, to function on the basis of the Commission's principal workload operations, and (2) such other divisional organizations as the Commission may deem necessary. Each such integrated bureau shall include such legal, engineering, accounting, administrative, clerical, and other personnel as the Commission may determine to be necessary to perform its functions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Delegation of functions; exceptions to initial orders; force, effect and enforcement of orders; administrative and judicial review; qualifications and compensation of delegates; assignment of cases; separation of review and investigative or prosecuting functions; secretary; seal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When necessary to the proper functioning of the Commission and the prompt and orderly conduct of its business, the Commission may, by published rule or by order, delegate any of its functions (except functions granted to the Commission by this paragraph and by paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection and except any action referred to in sections 204(a)(2), 208(b), and 405(b) of this title) to a panel of commissioners, an individual commissioner, an employee board, or an individual employee, including functions with respect to hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting, or otherwise acting as to any work, business, or matter; except that in delegating review functions to employees in cases of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title 5), the delegation in any such case may be made only to an employee board consisting of two or more employees referred to in paragraph (8) of this subsection. Any such rule or order may be adopted, amended, or rescinded only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Commission then holding office. Except for cases involving the authorization of service in the instructional television fixed service, or as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Commission to provide for the conduct, by any person or persons other than persons referred to in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 556(b) of title 5, of any hearing to which such section applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection the term &quot;order, decision, report, or action&quot; does not include an initial, tentative, or recommended decision to which exceptions may be filed as provided in section 409(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any order, decision, report, or action made or taken pursuant to any such delegation, unless reviewed as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, shall have the same force and effect, and shall be made, evidenced, and enforced in the same manner, as orders, decisions, reports, or other actions of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any person aggrieved by any such order, decision, report or action may file an application for review by the Commission within such time and in such manner as the Commission shall prescribe, and every such application shall be passed upon by the Commission. The Commission, on its own initiative, may review in whole or in part, at such time and in such manner as it shall determine, any order, decision, report, or action made or taken pursuant to any delegation under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In passing upon applications for review, the Commission may grant, in whole or in part, or deny such applications without specifying any reasons therefor. No such application for review shall rely on questions of fact or law upon which the panel of commissioners, individual commissioner, employee board, or individual employee has been afforded no opportunity to pass.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the Commission grants the application for review, it may affirm, modify, or set aside the order, decision, report, or action, or it may order a rehearing upon such order, decision, report, or action in accordance with section 405 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The filing of an application for review under this subsection shall be a condition precedent to judicial review of any order, decision, report, or action made or taken pursuant to a delegation under paragraph (1) of this subsection. The time within which a petition for review must be filed in a proceeding to which section 402(a) of this title applies, or within which an appeal must be taken under section 402(b) of this title, shall be computed from the date upon which public notice is given of orders disposing of all applications for review filed in any case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The employees to whom the Commission may delegate review functions in any case of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title 5) shall be qualified, by reason of their training, experience, and competence, to perform such review functions, and shall perform no duties inconsistent with such review functions. Such employees shall be in a grade classification or salary level commensurate with their important duties, and in no event less than the grade classification or salary level of the employee or employees whose actions are to be reviewed. In the performance of such review functions such employees shall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable and shall not be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of any officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for any agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The secretary and seal of the Commission shall be the secretary and seal of each panel of the Commission, each individual commissioner, and each employee board or individual employee exercising functions delegated pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Meetings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Meetings of the Commission shall be held at regular intervals, not less frequently than once each calendar month, at which times the functioning of the Commission and the handling of its work load shall be reviewed and such orders shall be entered and other action taken as may be necessary or appropriate to expedite the prompt and orderly conduct of the business of the Commission with the objective of rendering a final decision (1) within three months from the date of filing in all original application, renewal, and transfer cases in which it will not be necessary to hold a hearing, and (2) within six months from the final date of the hearing in all hearing cases.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Managing Director; appointment, functions, pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall have a Managing Director who shall be appointed by the Chairman subject to the approval of the Commission.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulatory flexibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 332(c)(1)(A) of this title, the Commission shall forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of this chapter to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service, or class of telecommunications carriers or telecommunications services, in any or some of its or their geographic markets, if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations by, for, or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Competitive effect to be weighed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making the determination under subsection (a)(3), the Commission shall consider whether forbearance from enforcing the provision or regulation will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such forbearance will enhance competition among providers of telecommunications services. If the Commission determines that such forbearance will promote competition among providers of telecommunications services, that determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that forbearance is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petition for forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any telecommunications carrier, or class of telecommunications carriers, may submit a petition to the Commission requesting that the Commission exercise the authority granted under this section with respect to that carrier or those carriers, or any service offered by that carrier or carriers. Any such petition shall be deemed granted if the Commission does not deny the petition for failure to meet the requirements for forbearance under subsection (a) within one year after the Commission receives it, unless the one-year period is extended by the Commission. The Commission may extend the initial one-year period by an additional 90 days if the Commission finds that an extension is necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (a). The Commission may grant or deny a petition in whole or in part and shall explain its decision in writing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 251(f) of this title, the Commission may not forbear from applying the requirements of section 251(c) or 271 of this title under subsection (a) of this section until it determines that those requirements have been fully implemented.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State enforcement after Commission forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State commission may not continue to apply or enforce any provision of this chapter that the Commission has determined to forbear from applying under subsection (a).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Whenever there is filed with the Commission any new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice, the Commission may either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness thereof; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the Commission, upon delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such charge, classification, regulation, or practice, in whole or in part but not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing the Commission may make such order with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after such charge, classification, regulation, or practice had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of the suspension, the proposed new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall go into effect at the end of such period; but in case of a proposed charge for a new service or a revised charge, the Commission may by order require the interested carrier or carriers to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of such charge for a new service or revised charge, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by further order require the interested carrier or carriers to refund, with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such charge for a new service or revised charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any hearing involving a new or revised charge, or a proposed new or revised charge, the burden of proof to show that the new or revised charge, or proposed charge, is just and reasonable shall be upon the carrier, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall, with respect to any hearing under this section, issue an order concluding such hearing within 5 months after the date that the charge, classification, regulation, or practice subject to the hearing becomes effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall, with respect to any such hearing initiated prior to November 3, 1988, issue an order concluding the hearing not later than 12 months after November 3, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any order concluding a hearing under this section shall be a final order and may be appealed under section 402(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A local exchange carrier may file with the Commission a new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice on a streamlined basis. Any such charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall be deemed lawful and shall be effective 7 days (in the case of a reduction in rates) or 15 days (in the case of an increase in rates) after the date on which it is filed with the Commission unless the Commission takes action under paragraph (1) before the end of that 7-day or 15-day period, as is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may allow part of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice to go into effect, based upon a written showing by the carrier or carriers affected, and an opportunity for written comment thereon by affected persons, that such partial authorization is just, fair, and reasonable. Additionally, or in combination with a partial authorization, the Commission, upon a similar showing, may allow all or part of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice to go into effect on a temporary basis pending further order of the Commission. Authorizations of temporary new or increased charges may include an accounting order of the type provided for in subsection (a).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may from time to time, as may be necessary for the proper administration of this chapter, and after opportunity for hearing, make a valuation of all or of any part of the property owned or used by any carrier subject to this chapter, as of such date as the Commission may fix.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inventory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may at any time require any such carrier to file with the Commission an inventory of all or of any part of the property owned or used by said carrier, which inventory shall show the units of said property classified in such detail, and in such manner, as the Commission shall direct, and shall show the estimated cost of reproduction new of said units, and their reproduction cost new less depreciation, as of such date as the Commission may direct; and such carrier shall file such inventory within such reasonable time as the Commission by order shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Original cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may at any time require any such carrier to file with the Commission a statement showing the original cost at the time of dedication to the public use of all or of any part of the property owned or used by said carrier. For the showing of such original cost said property shall be classified, and the original cost shall be defined, in such manner as the Commission may prescribe; and if any part of such cost cannot be determined from accounting or other records, the portion of the property for which such cost cannot be determined shall be reported to the Commission; and, if the Commission shall so direct, the original cost thereof shall be estimated in such manner as the Commission may prescribe. If the carrier owning the property at the time such original cost is reported shall have paid more or less than the original cost to acquire the same, the amount of such cost of acquisition, and any facts which the Commission may require in connection therewith, shall be reported with such original cost. The report made by a carrier under this subsection shall show the source or sources from which the original cost reported was obtained, and such other information as to the manner in which the report was prepared, as the Commission shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Easement, license or franchise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing shall be included in the original cost reported for the property of any carrier under subsection (c) of this section on account of any easement, license, or franchise granted by the United States or by any State or political subdivision thereof, beyond the reasonable necessary expense lawfully incurred in obtaining such easement, license, or franchise from the public authority aforesaid, which expense shall be reported separately from all other costs in such detail as the Commission may require; and nothing shall be included in any valuation of the property of any carrier made by the Commission on account of any such easement, license, or franchise, beyond such reasonable necessary expense lawfully incurred as aforesaid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Improvements; changes in condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall keep itself informed of all new construction, extensions, improvements, retirements, or other changes in the condition, quantity, use, and classification of the property of common carriers, and of the cost of all additions and betterments thereto and of all changes in the investment therein, and may keep itself informed of current changes in costs and values of carrier properties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional information; access to records and data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of enabling the Commission to make a valuation of any of the property of any such carrier, or to find the original cost of such property, or to find any other facts concerning the same which are required for use by the Commission, it shall be the duty of each such carrier to furnish to the Commission, within such reasonable time as the Commission may order, any information with respect thereto which the Commission may by order require, including copies of maps, contracts, reports of engineers, and other data, records, and papers, and to grant to all agents of the Commission free access to its property and its accounts, records, and memoranda whenever and wherever requested by any such duly authorized agent, and to cooperate with and aid the Commission in the work of making any such valuation or finding in such manner and to such extent as the Commission may require and direct, and all rules and regulations made by the Commission for the purpose of administering this section shall have the full force and effect of law. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, with the reasons therefor, the records and data of the Commission shall be open to the inspection and examination of the public.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exceptions; temporary or emergency service or discontinuance of service; changes in plant, operation or equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No carrier shall undertake the construction of a new line or of an extension of any line, or shall acquire or operate any line, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transmission over or by means of such additional or extended line, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line: <i>Provided</i>, That no such certificate shall be required under this section for the construction, acquisition, or operation of (1) a line within a single State unless such line constitutes part of an interstate line, (2) local, branch, or terminal lines not exceeding ten miles in length, or (3) any line acquired under section 221 of this title: <i>Provided further</i>, That the Commission may, upon appropriate request being made, authorize temporary or emergency service, or the supplementing of existing facilities, without regard to the provisions of this section. No carrier shall discontinue, reduce, or impair service to a community, or part of a community, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that neither the present nor future public convenience and necessity will be adversely affected thereby; except that the Commission may, upon appropriate request being made, authorize temporary or emergency discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, or partial discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, without regard to the provisions of this section. As used in this section the term &quot;line&quot; means any channel of communication established by the use of appropriate equipment, other than a channel of communication established by the interconnection of two or more existing channels: <i>Provided, however</i>, That nothing in this section shall be construed to require a certificate or other authorization from the Commission for any installation, replacement, or other changes in plant, operation, or equipment, other than new construction, which will not impair the adequacy or quality of service provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification of Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and State Governor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon receipt of an application for any such certificate, the Commission shall cause notice thereof to be given to, and shall cause a copy of such application to be filed with, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State (with respect to such applications involving service to foreign points), and the Governor of each State in which such line is proposed to be constructed, extended, acquired, or operated, or in which such discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service is proposed, with the right to those notified to be heard; and the Commission may require such published notice as it shall determine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval or disapproval; injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall have power to issue such certificate as applied for, or to refuse to issue it, or to issue it for a portion or portions of a line, or extension thereof, or discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, described in the application, or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and may attach to the issuance of the certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. After issuance of such certificate, and not before, the carrier may, without securing approval other than such certificate, comply with the terms and conditions contained in or attached to the issuance of such certificate and proceed with the construction, extension, acquisition, operation, or discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service covered thereby. Any construction, extension, acquisition, operation, discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service contrary to the provisions of this section may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the United States, the Commission, the State commission, any State affected, or any party in interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Order of Commission; hearing; penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, after full opportunity for hearing, in a proceeding upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, authorize or require by order any carrier, party to such proceeding, to provide itself with adequate facilities for the expeditious and efficient performance of its service as a common carrier and to extend its line or to establish a public office; but no such authorization or order shall be made unless the Commission finds, as to such provision of facilities, as to such establishment of public offices, or as to such extension, that it is reasonably required in the interest of public convenience and necessity, or as to such extension or facilities that the expense involved therein will not impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to the public. Any carrier which refuses or neglects to comply with any order of the Commission made in pursuance of this subsection shall forfeit to the United States $1,200 for each day during which such refusal or neglect continues.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Provision of universal service</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible telecommunications carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier under paragraph (2), (3), or (6) shall be eligible to receive universal service support in accordance with section 254 of this title and shall, throughout the service area for which the designation is received&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of this title, either using its own facilities or a combination of its own facilities and resale of another carrier's services (including the services offered by another eligible telecommunications carrier); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) advertise the availability of such services and the charges therefor using media of general distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission shall upon its own motion or upon request designate a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the State commission. Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the State commission may, in the case of an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the State commission, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the State commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers for unserved areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no common carrier will provide the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of this title to an unserved community or any portion thereof that requests such service, the Commission, with respect to interstate services or an area served by a common carrier to which paragraph (6) applies, or a State commission, with respect to intrastate services, shall determine which common carrier or carriers are best able to provide such service to the requesting unserved community or portion thereof and shall order such carrier or carriers to provide such service for that unserved community or portion thereof. Any carrier or carriers ordered to provide such service under this paragraph shall meet the requirements of paragraph (1) and shall be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier for that community or portion thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Relinquishment of universal service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall permit an eligible telecommunications carrier to relinquish its designation as such a carrier in any area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier. An eligible telecommunications carrier that seeks to relinquish its eligible telecommunications carrier designation for an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier shall give advance notice to the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) of such relinquishment. Prior to permitting a telecommunications carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier to cease providing universal service in an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier, the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall require the remaining eligible telecommunications carrier or carriers to ensure that all customers served by the relinquishing carrier will continue to be served, and shall require sufficient notice to permit the purchase or construction of adequate facilities by any remaining eligible telecommunications carrier. The State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall establish a time, not to exceed one year after the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) approves such relinquishment under this paragraph, within which such purchase or construction shall be completed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &quot;Service area&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;service area&quot; means a geographic area established by a State commission (or the Commission under paragraph (6)) for the purpose of determining universal service obligations and support mechanisms. In the case of an area served by a rural telephone company, &quot;service area&quot; means such company's &quot;study area&quot; unless and until the Commission and the States, after taking into account recommendations of a Federal-State Joint Board instituted under section 410(c) of this title, establish a different definition of service area for such company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Common carriers not subject to State commission jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a common carrier providing telephone exchange service and exchange access that is not subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission, the Commission shall upon request designate such a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the Commission consistent with applicable Federal and State law. Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity, the Commission may, with respect to an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated under this paragraph, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the Commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission may, in its discretion, prescribe the forms of any and all accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by carriers subject to this chapter, including the accounts, records, and memoranda of the movement of traffic, as well as of the receipts and expenditures of moneys.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, by rule, prescribe a uniform system of accounts for use by telephone companies. Such uniform system shall require that each common carrier shall maintain a system of accounting methods, procedures, and techniques (including accounts and supporting records and memoranda) which shall ensure a proper allocation of all costs to and among telecommunications services, facilities, and products (and to and among classes of such services, facilities, and products) which are developed, manufactured, or offered by such common carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Depreciation charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prescribe, for such carriers as it determines to be appropriate, the classes of property for which depreciation charges may be properly included under operating expenses, and the percentages of depreciation which shall be charged with respect to each of such classes of property, classifying the carriers as it may deem proper for this purpose. The Commission may, when it deems necessary, modify the classes and percentages so prescribed. Such carriers shall not, after the Commission has prescribed the classes of property for which depreciation charges may be included, charge to operating expenses any depreciation charges on classes of property other than those prescribed by the Commission, or, after the Commission has prescribed percentages of depreciation, charge with respect to any class of property a percentage of depreciation other than that prescribed therefor by the Commission. No such carrier shall in any case include in any form under its operating or other expenses any depreciation or other charge or expenditure included elsewhere as a depreciation charge or otherwise under its operating or other expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Access to information; burden of proof; use of independent auditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall at all times have access to and the right of inspection and examination of all accounts, records, and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and correspondence now or hereafter existing, and kept or required to be kept by such carriers, and the provisions of this section respecting the preservation and destruction of books, papers, and documents shall apply thereto. The burden of proof to justify every accounting entry questioned by the Commission shall be on the person making, authorizing, or requiring such entry and the Commission may suspend a charge or credit pending submission of proof by such person. Any provision of law prohibiting the disclosure of the contents of messages or communications shall not be deemed to prohibit the disclosure of any matter in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Commission may obtain the services of any person licensed to provide public accounting services under the law of any State to assist with, or conduct, audits under this section. While so employed or engaged in conducting an audit for the Commission under this section, any such person shall have the powers granted the Commission under this subsection and shall be subject to subsection (f) in the same manner as if that person were an employee of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Penalty for failure to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of failure or refusal on the part of any such carrier to keep such accounts, records, and memoranda on the books and in the manner prescribed by the Commission, or to submit such accounts, records, memoranda, documents, papers, and correspondence as are kept to the inspection of the Commission or any of its authorized agents, such carrier shall forfeit to the United States the sum of $6,000 for each day of the continuance of each such offense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) False entry; destruction; penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who shall willfully make any false entry in the accounts of any book of accounts or in any record or memoranda kept by any such carrier, or who shall willfully destroy, mutilate, alter, or by any other means or device falsify any such account, record, or memoranda, or who shall willfully neglect or fail to make full, true, and correct entries in such accounts, records, or memoranda of all facts and transactions appertaining to the business of the carrier, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 or imprisonment for a term of not less than one year nor more than three years, or both such fine and imprisonment: <i>Provided</i>, That the Commission may in its discretion issue orders specifying such operating, accounting, or financial papers, records, books, blanks, or documents which may, after a reasonable time, be destroyed, and prescribing the length of time such books, papers, or documents shall be preserved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Confidentiality of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No member, officer, or employee of the Commission shall divulge any fact or information which may come to his knowledge during the course of examination of books or other accounts, as hereinbefore provided, except insofar as he may be directed by the Commission or by a court.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The term &quot;utility&quot; means any person who is a local exchange carrier or an electric, gas, water, steam, or other public utility, and who owns or controls poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way used, in whole or in part, for any wire communications. Such term does not include any railroad, any person who is cooperatively organized, or any person owned by the Federal Government or any State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The term &quot;Federal Government&quot; means the Government of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The term &quot;State&quot; means any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The term &quot;pole attachment&quot; means any attachment by a cable television system or provider of telecommunications service to a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by a utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this section, the term &quot;telecommunications carrier&quot; (as defined in section 153 of this title) does not include any incumbent local exchange carrier as defined in section 251(h) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of Commission to regulate rates, terms, and conditions; enforcement powers; promulgation of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments to provide that such rates, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable, and shall adopt procedures necessary and appropriate to hear and resolve complaints concerning such rates, terms, and conditions. For purposes of enforcing any determinations resulting from complaint procedures established pursuant to this subsection, the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate and necessary, including issuing cease and desist orders, as authorized by section 312(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall prescribe by rule regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State regulatory authority over rates, terms, and conditions; preemption; certification; circumstances constituting State regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to, or to give the Commission jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms, and conditions, or access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way as provided in subsection (f), for pole attachments in any case where such matters are regulated by a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each State which regulates the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments shall certify to the Commission that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it regulates such rates, terms, and conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in so regulating such rates, terms, and conditions, the State has the authority to consider and does consider the interests of the subscribers of the services offered via such attachments, as well as the interests of the consumers of the utility services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, a State shall not be considered to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) unless the State has issued and made effective rules and regulations implementing the State's regulatory authority over pole attachments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to any individual matter, unless the State takes final action on a complaint regarding such matter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) within 180 days after the complaint is filed with the State, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) within the applicable period prescribed for such final action in such rules and regulations of the State, if the prescribed period does not extend beyond 360 days after the filing of such complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of just and reasonable rates; &quot;usable space&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, a rate is just and reasonable if it assures a utility the recovery of not less than the additional costs of providing pole attachments, nor more than an amount determined by multiplying the percentage of the total usable space, or the percentage of the total duct or conduit capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by the sum of the operating expenses and actual capital costs of the utility attributable to the entire pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &quot;usable space&quot; means the space above the minimum grade level which can be used for the attachment of wires, cables, and associated equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable television system solely to provide cable service. Until the effective date of the regulations required under subsection (e), this subsection shall also apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable system or any telecommunications carrier (to the extent such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment agreement) to provide any telecommunications service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations governing charges; apportionment of costs of providing space</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after February 8, 1996, prescribe regulations in accordance with this subsection to govern the charges for pole attachments used by telecommunications carriers to provide telecommunications services, when the parties fail to resolve a dispute over such charges. Such regulations shall ensure that a utility charges just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates for pole attachments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space among entities so that such apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing space other than the usable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of such costs among all attaching entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing usable space among all entities according to the percentage of usable space required for each entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The regulations required under paragraph (1) shall become effective 5 years after February 8, 1996. Any increase in the rates for pole attachments that result from the adoption of the regulations required by this subsection shall be phased in equal annual increments over a period of 5 years beginning on the effective date of such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nondiscriminatory access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric service may deny a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier access to its poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory&#160;<sup><a href="#224_1_target" name="224_1">1</a></sup> basis where there is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety, reliability and generally applicable engineering purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Imputation to costs of pole attachment rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications services or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing such services (and charge any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate company engaged in the provision of such services) an equal amount to the pole attachment rate for which such company would be liable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Modification or alteration of pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the owner of a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way intends to modify or alter such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way, the owner shall provide written notification of such action to any entity that has obtained an attachment to such conduit or right-of-way so that such entity may have a reasonable opportunity to add to or modify its existing attachment. Any entity that adds to or modifies its existing attachment after receiving such notification shall bear a proportionate share of the costs incurred by the owner in making such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way accessible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Costs of rearranging or replacing attachment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An entity that obtains an attachment to a pole, conduit, or right-of-way shall not be required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its attachment, if such rearrangement or replacement is required as a result of an additional attachment or the modification of an existing attachment sought by any other entity (including the owner of such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Common carrier or carrier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;common carrier&quot; or &quot;carrier&quot; includes any common carrier engaged in interstate communication by wire or radio as defined in section 153 of this title and any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication by wire or radio, notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;TDD&quot; means a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, which is a machine that employs graphic communication in the transmission of coded signals through a wire or radio communication system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Telecommunications relay services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;telecommunications relay services&quot; means telephone transmission services that provide the ability for an individual who is deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, or who has a speech disability to engage in communication by wire or radio with one or more individuals, in a manner that is functionally equivalent to the ability of a hearing individual who does not have a speech disability to communicate using voice communication services by wire or radio.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of telecommunications relay services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to carry out the purposes established under section 151 of this title, to make available to all individuals in the United States a rapid, efficient nationwide communication service, and to increase the utility of the telephone system of the Nation, the Commission shall ensure that interstate and intrastate telecommunications relay services are available, to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner, to hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of general authority and remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder, the Commission shall have the same authority, power, and functions with respect to common carriers engaged in intrastate communication as the Commission has in administering and enforcing the provisions of this subchapter with respect to any common carrier engaged in interstate communication. Any violation of this section by any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication shall be subject to the same remedies, penalties, and procedures as are applicable to a violation of this chapter by a common carrier engaged in interstate communication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each common carrier providing telephone voice transmission services shall, not later than 3 years after July 26, 1990, provide in compliance with the regulations prescribed under this section, throughout the area in which it offers service, telecommunications relay services, individually, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or in concert with other carriers. A common carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with such regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that does not have a certified program under subsection (f) and with respect to interstate telecommunications relay services, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the Commission's regulations under subsection (d); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that has a certified program under subsection (f) for such State, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the program certified under subsection (f) for such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, not later than 1 year after July 26, 1990, prescribe regulations to implement this section, including regulations that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish minimum standards that shall be met in carrying out subsection (c);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require that telecommunications relay services operate every day for 24 hours per day;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) require that users of telecommunications relay services pay rates no greater than the rates paid for functionally equivalent voice communication services with respect to such factors as the duration of the call, the time of day, and the distance from point of origination to point of termination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) prohibit relay operators from failing to fulfill the obligations of common carriers by refusing calls or limiting the length of calls that use telecommunications relay services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prohibit relay operators from disclosing the content of any relayed conversation and from keeping records of the content of any such conversation beyond the duration of the call; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) prohibit relay operators from intentionally altering a relayed conversation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall ensure that regulations prescribed to implement this section encourage, consistent with section 157(a) of this title, the use of existing technology and do not discourage or impair the development of improved technology.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Jurisdictional separation of costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Consistent with the provisions of section 410 of this title, the Commission shall prescribe regulations governing the jurisdictional separation of costs for the services provided pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Recovering costs</h4>

In a State that has a certified program under subsection (f), a State commission shall permit a common carrier to recover the costs incurred in providing intrastate telecommunications relay services by a method consistent with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsections (f) and (g), the Commission shall enforce this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall resolve, by final order, a complaint alleging a violation of this section within 180 days after the date such complaint is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any State desiring to establish a State program under this section shall submit documentation to the Commission that describes the program of such State for implementing intrastate telecommunications relay services and the procedures and remedies available for enforcing any requirements imposed by the State program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements for certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After review of such documentation, the Commission shall certify the State program if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the program makes available to hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals, either directly, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or through regulation of intrastate common carriers, intrastate telecommunications relay services in such State in a manner that meets or exceeds the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the program makes available adequate procedures and remedies for enforcing the requirements of the State program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsection (d), the Commission shall not refuse to certify a State program based solely on the method such State will implement for funding intrastate telecommunication relay services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Suspension or revocation of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may suspend or revoke such certification if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission determines that such certification is no longer warranted. In a State whose program has been suspended or revoked, the Commission shall take such steps as may be necessary, consistent with this section, to ensure continuity of telecommunications relay services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Complaint</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Referral of complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a complaint to the Commission alleges a violation of this section with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services within a State and certification of the program of such State under subsection (f) is in effect, the Commission shall refer such complaint to such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After referring a complaint to a State under paragraph (1), the Commission shall exercise jurisdiction over such complaint only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 101&ndash;435, &sect;2, Oct. 17, 1990, 104 Stat. 986, provided that: &quot;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) the divestiture of AT&amp;T and decisions allowing open entry for competitors in the telephone marketplace produced a variety of new services and many new providers of existing telephone services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) the growth of competition in the telecommunications market makes it essential to ensure that safeguards are in place to assure fairness for consumers and service providers alike;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) a variety of providers of operator services now compete to win contracts to provide operator services to hotels, hospitals, airports, and other aggregators of telephone business from consumers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) the mere existence of a variety of service providers in the operator services marketplace is significant in making that market competitive only when consumers are able to make informed choices from among those service providers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) however, often consumers have no choices in selecting a provider of operator services, and often attempts by consumers to reach their preferred long distance carrier by using a telephone billing card, credit card, or prearranged access code number are blocked;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) a number of State regulatory authorities have taken action to protect consumers using intrastate operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) from January 1988 through February 1990, the Federal Communications Commission received over 4,000 complaints from consumers about operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) those consumers have complained that they are denied access to the interexchange carrier of their choice, that they are deceived about the identity of the company providing operator services for their calls and the rates being charged, that they lack information on what they can do to complain about unfair treatment by an operator service provider, and that they are, accordingly, being deprived of the free choice essential to the operation of a competitive market;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) the Commission has testified that its actions have been insufficient to correct the problems in the operator services industry to date; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) a combination of industry self-regulation and government regulation is required to ensure that competitive operator services are provided in a fair and reasonable manner.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;243, &sect;2, Dec. 20, 1991, 105 Stat. 2394, provided that: &quot;The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) The use of the telephone to market goods and services to the home and other businesses is now pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Over 30,000 businesses actively telemarket goods and services to business and residential customers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) More than 300,000 solicitors call more than 18,000,000 Americans every day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Total United States sales generated through telemarketing amounted to $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold increase since 1984.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Unrestricted telemarketing, however, can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and, when an emergency or medical assistance telephone line is seized, a risk to public safety.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Over half the States now have statutes restricting various uses of the telephone for marketing, but telemarketers can evade their prohibitions through interstate operations; therefore, Federal law is needed to control residential telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) The Constitution does not prohibit restrictions on commercial telemarketing solicitations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) Individuals&apos; privacy rights, public safety interests, and commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that residential telephone subscribers consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) Technologies that might allow consumers to avoid receiving such calls are not universally available, are costly, are unlikely to be enforced, or place an inordinate burden on the consumer.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) While the evidence presented to the Congress indicates that automated or prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy, regardless of the type of call, the Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to design different rules for those types of automated or prerecorded calls that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of privacy, or for noncommercial calls, consistent with the free speech protections embodied in the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(14) Businesses also have complained to the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission that automated or prerecorded telephone calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and interfere with interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(15) The Federal Communications Commission should consider adopting reasonable restrictions on automated or prerecorded calls to businesses as well as to the home, consistent with the constitutional protections of free speech.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Extension of implementation deadline</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Burdens and barriers to implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 12 months after December 30, 2019, and as appropriate thereafter, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall assess any burdens or barriers to the implementation required by paragraph (1), including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for providers of voice service to the extent the networks of such providers use time-division multiplexing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for small providers of voice service and those in rural areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the inability to purchase or upgrade equipment to support the call authentication frameworks under this section, or lack of availability of such equipment; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in connection with an assessment under clause (i), may, upon a public finding of undue hardship, delay required compliance with the 18-month time period described in paragraph (1), for a reasonable period of time, for a provider or class of providers of voice service, or type of voice calls, as necessary for that provider or class of providers or type of calls to participate in the implementation in order to address the identified burdens and barriers.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Delay of compliance required for certain non-internet protocol networks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (C) through (F), for any provider or class of providers of voice service, or type of voice calls, only to the extent that such a provider or class of providers of voice service, or type of voice calls, materially relies on a non-internet protocol network for the provision of such service or calls, the Commission shall grant a delay of required compliance under subparagraph (A)(ii) until a call authentication protocol has been developed for calls delivered over non-internet protocol networks and is reasonably available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Robocall mitigation program</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Program required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">During the time of a delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Commission shall require, pursuant to the authority of the Commission, that any provider subject to such delay shall implement an appropriate robocall mitigation program to prevent unlawful robocalls from originating on the network of the provider.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Additional requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the consortium registered under section 13(d) identifies a provider of voice service that is subject to a delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii) as repeatedly originating large-scale unlawful robocall campaigns, the Commission shall require such provider to take action to ensure that such provider does not continue to originate such calls.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Minimization of burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission shall make reasonable efforts to minimize the burden of any robocall mitigation required pursuant to clause (ii), which may include prescribing certain specific robocall mitigation practices for providers of voice service that have repeatedly originated large-scale unlawful robocall campaigns.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Full participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall take reasonable measures to address any issues in an assessment under subparagraph (A)(i) and enable as promptly as reasonable full participation of all classes of providers of voice service and types of voice calls to receive the highest level of trust. Such measures shall include, without limitation, as appropriate, limiting or terminating a delay of compliance granted to a provider under subparagraph (B) if the Commission determines in such assessment that the provider is not making reasonable efforts to develop the call authentication protocol described in such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Alternative methodologies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall identify, in consultation with small providers of voice service and those in rural areas, alternative effective methodologies to protect customers from unauthenticated calls during any delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Revision of delay of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not less frequently than annually after the first delay of compliance is granted under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall consider revising or extending any delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may revise such delay of compliance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall issue a public notice with regard to whether such delay of compliance remains necessary, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) why such delay of compliance remains necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) when the Commission expects to achieve the goal of full participation as described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) No additional cost to consumers or small business customers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prohibit providers of voice service from adding any additional line item charges to consumer or small business customer subscribers for the effective call authentication technology required under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Accurate identification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 12 months after December 30, 2019, the Commission shall issue best practices that providers of voice service may use as part of the implementation of effective call authentication frameworks under paragraph (1) to take steps to ensure the calling party is accurately identified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Safe harbor and other regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consistent with the regulations prescribed under subsection (j) of section 227 of this title, as added by section 10, the Commission shall, not later than 1 year after December 30, 2019, promulgate rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishing when a provider of voice service may block a voice call based, in whole or in part, on information provided by the call authentication frameworks under subsection (b), with no additional line item charge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establishing a safe harbor for a provider of voice service from liability for unintended or inadvertent blocking of calls or for the unintended or inadvertent misidentification of the level of trust for individual calls based, in whole or in part, on information provided by the call authentication frameworks under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) establishing a process to permit a calling party adversely affected by the information provided by the call authentication frameworks under subsection (b) to verify the authenticity of the calling party's calls; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensuring that calls originating from a provider of voice service in an area where the provider is subject to a delay of compliance with the time period described in subsection (b)(1) are not unreasonably blocked because the calls are not able to be authenticated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the safe harbor under paragraph (1), consistent with the regulations prescribed under subsection (j) of section 227 of this title, as added by section 10, the Commission shall consider limiting the liability of a provider of voice service based on the extent to which the provider of voice service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) blocks or identifies calls based, in whole or in part, on the information provided by the call authentication frameworks under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) implemented procedures based, in whole or in part, on the information provided by the call authentication frameworks under subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) used reasonable care, including making all reasonable efforts to avoid blocking emergency public safety calls.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from initiating a rulemaking pursuant to its existing statutory authority.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to put into effect a system of national regulation and review that will oversee interstate pay-per-call services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to recognize the Commission's authority to prescribe regulations and enforcement procedures and conduct oversight to afford reasonable protection to consumers of pay-per-call services and to assure that violations of Federal law do not occur.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General authority for regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission by regulation shall, within 270 days after October 28, 1992, establish a system for oversight and regulation of pay-per-call services in order to provide for the protection of consumers in accordance with this chapter and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Commission's final rules shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) include measures that provide a consumer of pay-per-call services with adequate and clear descriptions of the rights of the caller;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) define the obligations of common carriers with respect to the provision of pay-per-call services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include requirements on such carriers to protect against abusive practices by providers of pay-per-call services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) identify procedures by which common carriers and providers of pay-per-call services may take affirmative steps to protect against nonpayment of legitimate charges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) require that any service described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (i)(1) be offered only through the use of certain telephone number prefixes and area codes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Common carrier obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 270 days after October 28, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish the following requirements for common carriers:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Contractual obligations to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any common carrier assigning to a provider of pay-per-call services a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) shall require by contract or tariff that such provider comply with the provisions of titles II and III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.; 5721 et seq.] and the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to those titles.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Information availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that by tariff or contract assigns a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) to a provider of a pay-per-call service shall make readily available on request to Federal and State agencies and other interested persons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a list of the telephone numbers for each of the pay-per-call services it carries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a short description of each such service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such other information as the Commission considers necessary for the enforcement of this section and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Compliance procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that by contract or tariff assigns a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) to a provider of pay-per-call services shall terminate, in accordance with procedures specified in such regulations, the offering of a pay-per-call service of a provider if the carrier knows or reasonably should know that such service is not provided in compliance with title II or III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.; 5721 et seq.] or the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to such titles.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Subscriber disconnection prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier shall not disconnect or interrupt a subscriber's local exchange telephone service or long distance telephone service because of nonpayment of charges for any pay-per-call service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Blocking and presubscription</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that provides local exchange service shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer telephone subscribers (where technically feasible) the option of blocking access from their telephone number to all, or to certain specific, prefixes or area codes used by pay-per-call services, which option&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be offered at no charge (I) to all subscribers for a period of 60 days after the issuance of the regulations under subsection (b), and (II) to any subscriber who subscribes to a new telephone number until 60 days after the time the new telephone number is effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall otherwise be offered at a reasonable fee; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) offer telephone subscribers (where the Commission determines it is technically and economically feasible), in combination with the blocking option described under subparagraph (A), the option of presubscribing to or blocking only specific pay-per-call services for a reasonable one-time charge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph may permit the costs of such blocking to be recovered by contract or tariff, but such costs may not be recovered from local or long-distance ratepayers. Nothing in this subsection precludes a common carrier from filing its rates and regulations regarding blocking and presubscription in its interstate tariffs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Verification of charitable status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that assigns by contract or tariff a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) to a provider of pay-per-call services that the carrier knows or reasonably should know is engaged in soliciting charitable contributions shall obtain from such provider proof of the tax exempt status of any person or organization for which contributions are solicited.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier shall prohibit by tariff or contract the use of any 800 telephone number, or other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free, in a manner that would result in&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the calling party being assessed, by virtue of being asked to connect or otherwise transfer to a pay-per-call service, a charge for the call.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Subscription agreements for billing for information provided via toll-free calls</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (7)(C)(i), a written subscription does not meet the requirements of this paragraph unless the agreement specifies the material terms and conditions under which the information is offered and includes&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the phone bill shall include, in prominent type, the following disclaimer:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">&quot;Common carriers may not disconnect local or long distance telephone service for failure to pay disputed charges for information services.&quot;; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the phone bill shall clearly list the 800 number dialed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Use of PINs to prevent unauthorized use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A written agreement does not meet the requirements of this paragraph unless it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) includes a unique personal identification number or other subscriber-specific identifier and requires a subscriber to use this number or identifier to obtain access to the information provided and includes instructions on its use; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) assures that any charges for services accessed by use of the subscriber's personal identification number or subscriber-specific identifier be assessed to subscriber's source of payment elected pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for calls utilizing telecommunications devices for the deaf;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for directory services provided by a common carrier or its affiliate or by a local exchange carrier or its affiliate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for any purchase of goods or of services that are not information services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Increasingly Americans are relying on interactive media for a variety of political, educational, cultural, and entertainment services.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to a rural telephone company until (i) such company has received a bona fide request for interconnection, services, or network elements, and (ii) the State commission determines (under subparagraph (B)) that such request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) State termination of exemption and implementation schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The party making a bona fide request of a rural telephone company for interconnection, services, or network elements shall submit a notice of its request to the State commission.

The State commission shall grant such petition to the extent that, and for such duration as, the State commission determines that such suspension or modification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly economically burdensome; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is technically infeasible; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>

Pending such action, the State commission may suspend enforcement of the requirement or requirements to which the petition applies with respect to the petitioning carrier or carriers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Continued enforcement of exchange access and interconnection requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after February 8, 1996, each local exchange carrier, to the extent that it provides wireline services, shall provide exchange access, information access, and exchange services for such access to interexchange carriers and information service providers in accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of compensation) that apply to such carrier on the date immediately preceding February 8, 1996, under any court order, consent decree, or regulation, order, or policy of the Commission, until such restrictions and obligations are explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the Commission after February 8, 1996. During the period beginning on February 8, 1996, and until such restrictions and obligations are so superseded, such restrictions and obligations shall be enforceable in the same manner as regulations of the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on February 8, 1996, provided telephone exchange service in such area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) on February 8, 1996, was deemed to be a member of the exchange carrier association pursuant to section 69.601(b) of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 69.601(b)); or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such carrier has substantially replaced an incumbent local exchange carrier described in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such treatment is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity and the purposes of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Agreements arrived at through negotiation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Voluntary negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receiving a request for interconnection, services, or network elements pursuant to section 251 of this title, an incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier or carriers without regard to the standards set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of section 251 of this title. The agreement shall include a detailed schedule of itemized charges for interconnection and each service or network element included in the agreement. The agreement, including any interconnection agreement negotiated before February 8, 1996, shall be submitted to the State commission under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mediation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any party negotiating an agreement under this section may, at any point in the negotiation, ask a State commission to participate in the negotiation and to mediate any differences arising in the course of the negotiation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period from the 135th to the 160th day (inclusive) after the date on which an incumbent local exchange carrier receives a request for negotiation under this section, the carrier or any other party to the negotiation may petition a State commission to arbitrate any open issues.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duty of petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A party that petitions a State commission under paragraph (1) shall, at the same time as it submits the petition, provide the State commission all relevant documentation concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the unresolved issues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the position of each of the parties with respect to those issues; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any other issue discussed and resolved by the parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A party petitioning a State commission under paragraph (1) shall provide a copy of the petition and any documentation to the other party or parties not later than the day on which the State commission receives the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A non-petitioning party to a negotiation under this section may respond to the other party's petition and provide such additional information as it wishes within 25 days after the State commission receives the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action by State commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The State commission shall limit its consideration of any petition under paragraph (1) (and any response thereto) to the issues set forth in the petition and in the response, if any, filed under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The State commission may require the petitioning party and the responding party to provide such information as may be necessary for the State commission to reach a decision on the unresolved issues. If any party refuses or fails unreasonably to respond on a timely basis to any reasonable request from the State commission, then the State commission may proceed on the basis of the best information available to it from whatever source derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The State commission shall resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection (c) upon the parties to the agreement, and shall conclude the resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after the date on which the local exchange carrier received the request under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Refusal to negotiate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence, or with the assistance, of the State commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standards for arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In resolving by arbitration under subsection (b) any open issues and imposing conditions upon the parties to the agreement, a State commission shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) based on the cost (determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding) of providing the interconnection or network element (whichever is applicable), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) nondiscriminatory, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may include a reasonable profit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges for transport and termination of traffic</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of compliance by an incumbent local exchange carrier with section 251(b)(5) of this title, a State commission shall not consider the terms and conditions for reciprocal compensation to be just and reasonable unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such terms and conditions provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the transport and termination on each carrier's network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such terms and conditions determine such costs on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs of terminating such calls.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to preclude arrangements that afford the mutual recovery of costs through the offsetting of reciprocal obligations, including arrangements that waive mutual recovery (such as bill-and-keep arrangements); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to authorize the Commission or any State commission to engage in any rate regulation proceeding to establish with particularity the additional costs of transporting or terminating calls, or to require carriers to maintain records with respect to the additional costs of such calls.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of section 251(c)(4) of this title, a State commission shall determine wholesale rates on the basis of retail rates charged to subscribers for the telecommunications service requested, excluding the portion thereof attributable to any marketing, billing, collection, and other costs that will be avoided by the local exchange carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Approval by State commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State commission may only reject&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by negotiation under subsection (a) if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by arbitration under subsection (b) if it finds that the agreement does not meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251 of this title, or the standards set forth in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Preservation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), but subject to section 253 of this title, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of State law in its review of an agreement, including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Schedule for decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the State commission does not act to approve or reject the agreement within 90 days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by negotiation under subsection (a), or within 30 days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by arbitration under subsection (b), the agreement shall be deemed approved. No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Commission to act if State will not act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State commission fails to act to carry out its responsibility under this section in any proceeding or other matter under this section, then the Commission shall issue an order preempting the State commission's jurisdiction of that proceeding or matter within 90 days after being notified (or taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume the responsibility of the State commission under this section with respect to the proceeding or matter and act for the State commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Review of State commission actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a case in which a State fails to act as described in paragraph (5), the proceeding by the Commission under such paragraph and any judicial review of the Commission's actions shall be the exclusive remedies for a State commission's failure to act. In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Statements of generally available terms</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bell operating company may prepare and file with a State commission a statement of the terms and conditions that such company generally offers within that State to comply with the requirements of section 251 of this title and the regulations thereunder and the standards applicable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State commission review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission may not approve such statement unless such statement complies with subsection (d) of this section and section 251 of this title and the regulations thereunder. Except as provided in section 253 of this title, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of State law in its review of such statement, including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Schedule for review</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) permit such statement to take effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authority to continue review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (3) shall not preclude the State commission from continuing to review a statement that has been permitted to take effect under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph or from approving or disapproving such statement under paragraph (2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State and local government authority</h4>

In addition to the members of the Joint Board required under section 410(c) of this title, one member of such Joint Board shall be a State-appointed utility consumer advocate nominated by a national organization of State utility consumer advocates. The Joint Board shall, after notice and opportunity for public comment, make its recommendations to the Commission 9 months after February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission action</h4>

Thereafter, the Commission shall complete any proceeding to implement subsequent recommendations from any Joint Board on universal service within one year after receiving such recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Universal service principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for the preservation and advancement of universal service on the following principles:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission shall establish periodically under this section, taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services. The Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms shall consider the extent to which such telecommunications services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are essential to education, public health, or public safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are being deployed in public telecommunications networks by telecommunications carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alterations and modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Joint Board may, from time to time, recommend to the Commission modifications in the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service. The Commission may exempt a carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if the carrier's telecommunications activities are limited to such an extent that the level of such carrier's contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service would be de minimis. Any other provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service if the public interest so requires.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Universal service support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the date on which Commission regulations implementing this section take effect, only an eligible telecommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service support. A carrier that receives such support shall use that support only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. Any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission's rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interexchange and interstate services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged by providers of interexchange telecommunications services to subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be no higher than the rates charged by each such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. Such rules shall also require that a provider of interstate interexchange telecommunications services shall provide such services to its subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the rates charged to its subscribers in any other State.</p>

A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall be entitled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the rates for services provided to health care providers for rural areas in a State and the rates for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas in that State treated as a service obligation as a part of its obligation to participate in the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Educational providers and libraries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal service under subsection (c)(3), provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties. The discount shall be an amount that the Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to intrastate services, determine is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of such services by such entities. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have an amount equal to the amount of the discount treated as an offset to its obligation to contribute to the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, receive reimbursement utilizing the support mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exception for previously authorized activities</h4>

The Commission shall ensure that the provision of services authorized under subsection (g) by a Bell operating company or its affiliate will not adversely affect telephone exchange service ratepayers or competition in any telecommunications market.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent video programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent and aggressive behavior later in life than children not so exposed, and that children exposed to violent video programming are prone to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed to an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on television by the time the child completes elementary school.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on television, eroding the ability of parents to develop responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual video programming and strongly support technology that would give them greater control to block video programming in the home that they consider harmful to their children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering parents to limit the negative influences of video programming that is harmful to children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) Providing parents with timely information about the nature of upcoming video programming and with the technological tools that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other programming that they believe harmful to their children is a nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of achieving that compelling governmental interest.&quot;</p>

<p class="note-body">[The Office of Telecommunications Policy was abolished and its functions transferred to the President and the Secretary of Commerce by secs. 3 and 5 of Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1977, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.]</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">We live in a time when the technology of telecommunications is undergoing rapid change which will dramatically affect the whole of our society. It has long been recognized that the executive branch of the Federal government should be better equipped to deal with the issues which arise from telecommunications growth. As the largest single user of the nation's telecommunications facilities, the Federal government must also manage its internal communications operations in the most effective manner possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">That plan would establish a new Office of Telecommunications Policy in the Executive Office of the President. The new unit would be headed by a Director and a Deputy Director who would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The existing office held by the Director of Telecommunications Management in the Office of Emergency Preparedness would be abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the functions which are transferred to it by the reorganization plan, the new Office would perform certain other duties which I intend to assign to it by Executive order as soon as the reorganization plan takes effect. That order would delegate to the new Office essentially those functions which are now assigned to the Director of Telecommunications Management. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would be assisted in its research and analysis responsibilities by the agencies and departments of the Executive Branch including another new office, located in the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office of Telecommunications Policy would play three essential roles:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. It would serve as the President's principal adviser on telecommunications policy, helping to formulate government policies concerning a wide range of domestic and international telecommunications issues and helping to develop plans and programs which take full advantage of the nation's technological capabilities. The speed of economic and technological advance in our time means that new questions concerning communications are constantly arising, questions on which the government must be well informed and well advised. The new Office will enable the President and all government officials to share more fully in the experience, the insights, and the forecasts of government and non-government experts.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would help formulate policies and coordinate operations for the Federal government's own vast communications systems. It would, for example, set guidelines for the various departments and agencies concerning their communications equipment and services. It would regularly review the ability of government communications systems to meet the security needs of the nation and to perform effectively in time of emergency. The Office would direct the assignment of those portions of the radio spectrum which are reserved for government use, carry out responsibilities conferred on the President by the Communications Satellite Act, advise State and local governments, and provide policy direction for the National Communications System.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Finally, the new Office would enable the executive branch to speak with a clearer vote and to act as a more effective partner in discussions of communications policy with both the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. This action would take away none of the prerogatives or functions assigned to the Federal Communications Commission by the Congress. It is my hope, however, that the new Office and the Federal Communications Commission would cooperate in achieving certain reforms in telecommunications policy, especially in their procedures for allocating portions of the radio spectrum for government and civilian use. Our current procedures must be more flexible if they are to deal adequately with problems such as the worsening spectrum shortage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), &quot;to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;&quot; and section 901(a)(3), &quot;to increase the efficiency of the operations of the government to the fullest extent practicable.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan should result in the more efficient operation of the government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The public interest requires that government policies concerning telecommunications be formulated with as much sophistication and vision as possible. This reorganization plan&mdash;and the executive order which would follow it&mdash;are necessary instruments if the government is to respond adequately to the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid pace of change in communications. I urge that the Congress allow this plan to become effective so that these necessary reforms can be accomplished.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In considering applications for licenses, and modifications and renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms of licenses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial and renewal licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each license granted for the operation of a broadcasting station shall be for a term of not to exceed 8 years. Upon application therefor, a renewal of such license may be granted from time to time for a term of not to exceed 8 years from the date of expiration of the preceding license, if the Commission finds that public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served thereby. Consistent with the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the Commission may by rule prescribe the period or periods for which licenses shall be granted and renewed for particular classes of stations, but the Commission may not adopt or follow any rule which would preclude it, in any case involving a station of a particular class, from granting or renewing a license for a shorter period than that prescribed for stations of such class if, in its judgment, the public interest, convenience, or necessity would be served by such action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Materials in application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to expedite action on applications for renewal of broadcasting station licenses and in order to avoid needless expense to applicants for such renewals, the Commission shall not require any such applicant to file any information which previously has been furnished to the Commission or which is not directly material to the considerations that affect the granting or denial of such application, but the Commission may require any new or additional facts it deems necessary to make its findings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Continuation pending decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending any administrative or judicial hearing and final decision on such an application and the disposition of any petition for rehearing pursuant to section 405 or section 402 of this title, the Commission shall continue such license in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Renewals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No renewal of an existing station license in the broadcast or the common carrier services shall be granted more than thirty days prior to the expiration of the original license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of certain radio stations without individual licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any license requirement established in this chapter, if the Commission determines that such authorization serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission may by rule authorize the operation of radio stations without individual licenses in the following radio services: (A) the citizens band radio service; (B) the radio control service; (C) the aviation radio service for aircraft stations operated on domestic flights when such aircraft are not otherwise required to carry a radio station; and (D) the maritime radio service for ship stations navigated on domestic voyages when such ships are not otherwise required to carry a radio station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any radio station operator who is authorized by the Commission to operate without an individual license shall comply with all other provisions of this chapter and with rules prescribed by the Commission under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the terms &quot;citizens band radio service&quot;, &quot;radio control service&quot;, &quot;aircraft station&quot; and &quot;ship station&quot; shall have the meanings given them by the Commission by rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Areas in Alaska without access to over the air broadcasts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, (1) any holder of a broadcast license may broadcast to an area of Alaska that otherwise does not have access to over the air broadcasts via translator, microwave, or other alternative signal delivery even if another holder of a broadcast license begins broadcasting to such area, (2) any holder of a broadcast license who has broadcast to an area of Alaska that did not have access to over the air broadcasts via translator, microwave, or other alternative signal delivery may continue providing such service even if another holder of a broadcast license begins broadcasting to such area, and shall not be fined or subject to any other penalty, forfeiture, or revocation related to providing such service including any fine, penalty, forfeiture, or revocation for continuing to operate notwithstanding orders to the contrary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications not affected by subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (b) of this section shall not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to any minor amendment of an application to which such subsection is applicable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to any application for&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petition to deny application; time; contents; reply; findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any party in interest may file with the Commission a petition to deny any application (whether as originally filed or as amended) to which subsection (b) of this section applies at any time prior to the day of Commission grant thereof without hearing or the day of formal designation thereof for hearing; except that with respect to any classification of applications, the Commission from time to time by rule may specify a shorter period (no less than thirty days following the issuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial amendment thereof), which shorter period shall be reasonably related to the time when the applications would normally be reached for processing. The petitioner shall serve a copy of such petition on the applicant. The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with subsection (a) (or subsection (k) in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license). Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The applicant shall be given the opportunity to file a reply in which allegations of fact or denials thereof shall similarly be supported by affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there are no substantial and material questions of fact and that a grant of the application would be consistent with subsection (a) (or subsection (k) in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license), it shall make the grant, deny the petition, and issue a concise statement of the reasons for denying the petition, which statement shall dispose of all substantial issues raised by the petition. If a substantial and material question of fact is presented or if the Commission for any reason is unable to find that grant of the application would be consistent with subsection (a) (or subsection (k) in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license), it shall proceed as provided in subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hearings; intervention; evidence; burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in the case of any application to which subsection (a) of this section applies, a substantial and material question of fact is presented or the Commission for any reason is unable to make the finding specified in such subsection, it shall formally designate the application for hearing on the ground or reasons then obtaining and shall forthwith notify the applicant and all other known parties in interest of such action and the grounds and reasons therefor, specifying with particularity the matters and things in issue but not including issues or requirements phrased generally. When the Commission has so designated an application for hearing the parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the Commission of such action may acquire the status of a party to the proceeding thereon by filing a petition for intervention showing the basis for their interest not more than thirty days after publication of the hearing issues or any substantial amendment thereto in the Federal Register. Any hearing subsequently held upon such application shall be a full hearing in which the applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate. The burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with respect to any issue presented by a petition to deny or a petition to enlarge the issues, such burdens shall be as determined by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Temporary authorization of temporary operations under subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an application subject to subsection (b) has been filed, the Commission, notwithstanding the requirements of such subsection, may, if the grant of such application is otherwise authorized by law and if it finds that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring temporary operations in the public interest and that delay in the institution of such temporary operations would seriously prejudice the public interest, grant a temporary authorization, accompanied by a statement of its reasons therefor, to permit such temporary operations for a period not exceeding 180 days, and upon making like findings may extend such temporary authorization for additional periods not to exceed 180 days. When any such grant of a temporary authorization is made, the Commission shall give expeditious treatment to any timely filed petition to deny such application and to any petition for rehearing of such grant filed under section 405 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No license or construction permit shall be granted to an applicant selected pursuant to paragraph (1) unless the Commission determines the qualifications of such applicant pursuant to subsection (a) and section 308(b) of this title. When substantial and material questions of fact exist concerning such qualifications, the Commission shall conduct a hearing in order to make such determinations. For the purpose of making such determinations, the Commission may, by rule, and notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission shall establish rules and procedures to ensure that, in the administration of any system of random selection under this subsection used for granting licenses or construction permits for any media of mass communications, significant preferences will be granted to applicants or groups of applicants, the grant to which of the license or permit would increase the diversification of ownership of the media of mass communications. To further diversify the ownership of the media of mass communications, an additional significant preference shall be granted to any applicant controlled by a member or members of a minority group.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall have authority to require each qualified applicant seeking a significant preference under subparagraph (A) to submit to the Commission such information as may be necessary to enable the Commission to make a determination regarding whether such applicant shall be granted such preference. Such information shall be submitted in such form, at such times, and in accordance with such procedures, as the Commission may require.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for hearing, prescribe rules establishing a system of random selection for use by the Commission under this subsection in any instance in which the Commission, in its discretion, determines that such use is appropriate for the granting of any license or permit in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, consistent with the obligations described in paragraph (6)(E), mutually exclusive applications are accepted for any initial license or construction permit, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), the Commission shall grant the license or permit to a qualified applicant through a system of competitive bidding that meets the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exemptions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each class of licenses or permits that the Commission grants through the use of a competitive bidding system, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish a competitive bidding methodology. The Commission shall seek to design and test multiple alternative methodologies under appropriate circumstances. The Commission shall, directly or by contract, provide for the design and conduct (for purposes of testing) of competitive bidding using a contingent combinatorial bidding system that permits prospective bidders to bid on combinations or groups of licenses in a single bid and to enter multiple alternative bids within a single bidding round. In identifying classes of licenses and permits to be issued by competitive bidding, in specifying eligibility and other characteristics of such licenses and permits, and in designing the methodologies for use under this subsection, the Commission shall include safeguards to protect the public interest in the use of the spectrum and shall seek to promote the purposes specified in section 151 of this title and the following objectives:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after issuance of bidding rules, to ensure that interested parties have a sufficient time to develop business plans, assess market conditions, and evaluate the availability of equipment for the relevant services; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) for any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)), the recovery of 110 percent of estimated relocation or sharing costs as provided to the Commission pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contents of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (3), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments, with or without royalty payments, or other schedules or methods that promote the objectives described in paragraph (3)(B), and combinations of such schedules and methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include performance requirements, such as appropriate deadlines and penalties for performance failures, to ensure prompt delivery of service to rural areas, to prevent stockpiling or warehousing of spectrum by licensees or permittees, and to promote investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes, consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) require such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed to issue licenses and permits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prescribe methods by which a reasonable reserve price will be required, or a minimum bid will be established, to obtain any license or permit being assigned pursuant to the competitive bidding, unless the Commission determines that such a reserve price or minimum bid is not in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Bidder and licensee qualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person shall be permitted to participate in a system of competitive bidding pursuant to this subsection unless such bidder submits such information and assurances as the Commission may require to demonstrate that such bidder's application is acceptable for filing. No license shall be granted to an applicant selected pursuant to this subsection unless the Commission determines that the applicant is qualified pursuant to subsection (a) and sections 308(b) and 310 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of this subsection, the Commission may not base a finding of public interest, convenience, and necessity solely or predominantly on the expectation of Federal revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consideration of demand for spectrum not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Commission from continuing to consider consumer demand for spectrum-based services.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;195, &sect;2, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 715, provided that: &quot;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in 1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum management principles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other advanced communications services. The Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The study being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation with the Department of Defense to determine whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other advanced communications services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the process of determining how to resolve the interference problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been conceived.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most productive use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the existing statutory framework provides; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) should advance the transition of digital television and must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent licensee.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Compliance With Auction Authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;195, &sect;4, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 717, provided that: &quot;The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 prior to the expiration of the auction authority under section 309(j)(11) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11)).&quot;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &quot;repeated&quot;, when used with reference to the commission or omission of any act, means the commission or omission of such act more than once or, if such commission or omission is continuous, for more than one day.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitation on silent station authorizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a broadcasting station fails to transmit broadcast signals for any consecutive 12-month period, then the station license granted for the operation of that broadcast station expires at the end of that period, notwithstanding any provision, term, or condition of the license to the contrary, except that the Commission may extend or reinstate such station license if the holder of the station license prevails in an administrative or judicial appeal, the applicable law changes, or for any other reason to promote equity and fairness.

<p class="statutory-body">No license shall be issued under the authority of this chapter for the operation of any station unless a permit for its construction has been granted by the Commission. The application for a construction permit shall set forth such facts as the Commission by regulation may prescribe as to the citizenship, character, and the financial, technical, and other ability of the applicant to construct and operate the station, the ownership and location of the proposed station and of the station or stations with which it is proposed to communicate, the frequencies desired to be used, the hours of the day or other periods of time during which it is proposed to operate the station, the purpose for which the station is to be used, the type of transmitting apparatus to be used, the power to be used, the date upon which the station is expected to be completed and in operation, and such other information as the Commission may require. Such application shall be signed by the applicant in any manner or form, including by electronic means, as the Commission may prescribe by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time limitation; forfeiture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such permit for construction shall show specifically the earliest and latest dates between which the actual operation of such station is expected to begin, and shall provide that said permit will be automatically forfeited if the station is not ready for operation within the time specified or within such further time as the Commission may allow, unless prevented by causes not under the control of the grantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Licenses for operation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the completion of any station for the construction or continued construction of which a permit has been granted, and upon it being made to appear to the Commission that all the terms, conditions, and obligations set forth in the application and permit have been fully met, and that no cause or circumstance arising or first coming to the knowledge of the Commission since the granting of the permit would, in the judgment of the Commission, make the operation of such station against the public interest, the Commission shall issue a license to the lawful holder of said permit for the operation of said station. Said license shall conform generally to the terms of said permit. The provisions of section 309(a)&ndash;(g) of this title shall not apply with respect to any station license the issuance of which is provided for and governed by the provisions of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of any proceeding under this subsection, any satellite carrier that retransmits the signal of any broadcast station shall be deemed to designate the Secretary of the Commission as its agent for service of process. A television broadcast station may serve a satellite carrier with a complaint concerning an alleged violation of subsection (b)(1) through retransmission of a station within the local market of such station by filing the original and two copies of the complaint with the Secretary of the Commission and serving a copy of the complaint on the satellite carrier by means of two commonly used overnight delivery services, each addressed to the chief executive officer of the satellite carrier at its principal place of business, and each marked &quot;URGENT LITIGATION MATTER&quot; on the outer packaging. Service shall be deemed complete one business day after a copy of the complaint is provided to the delivery services for overnight delivery.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Defenses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Exclusive defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The defenses under this paragraph are the exclusive defenses available to a satellite carrier against which a complaint under this subsection is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The defenses referred to under subparagraph (A) are the defenses that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the satellite carrier did not retransmit the television broadcast station to any person in the local market of the station during the time period specified in the complaint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the television broadcast station had, in a writing signed by an officer of the television broadcast station, expressly authorized the retransmission of the station by the satellite carrier to each person in the local market of the television broadcast station to which the satellite carrier made such retransmissions for the entire time period during which it is alleged that a violation of subsection (b)(1) has occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the retransmission was made after January 1, 2002, and the television broadcast station had elected to assert the right to carriage under section 338 of this title as against the satellite carrier for the relevant period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the station being retransmitted is a noncommercial television broadcast station.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Counting of violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The retransmission without consent of a particular television broadcast station on a particular day to one or more persons in the local market of the station shall be considered a separate violation of subsection (b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to each alleged violation, the burden of proof shall be on a television broadcast station to establish that the satellite carrier retransmitted the station to at least one person in the local market of the station on the day in question. The burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Procedures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall issue procedural regulations implementing this subsection which shall supersede procedures under section 312 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Within 45 days after the filing of a complaint, the Commission shall issue a final determination in any proceeding brought under this subsection. The Commission's final determination shall specify the number of violations committed by the satellite carrier. The Commission shall hear witnesses only if it clearly appears, based on written filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on written filings by the parties.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission may direct the parties to exchange pertinent documents, and if necessary to take prehearing depositions, on such schedule as the Commission may approve, but only if the Commission first determines that such discovery is necessary to resolve a genuine dispute about material facts, consistent with the obligation to make a final determination within 45 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one person in the local market of such station and has failed to meet its burden of proving one of the defenses under paragraph (4) with respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall be required to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make a finding that the satellite carrier violated subsection (b)(1) with respect to that station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issue an order, within 45 days after the filing of the complaint, containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier immediately to stop making any further retransmissions of the television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station until such time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) with respect to such station;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the satellite carrier is found to have violated subsection (b)(1) with respect to more than two television broadcast stations, a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier to stop making any further retransmission of any television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station, until such time as the Commission, after giving notice to the station, that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) with respect to such stations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an award to the complainant of that complainant's costs and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Court proceedings on enforcement of Commission order</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On entry by the Commission of a final order granting relief under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a television broadcast station may apply within 30 days after such entry to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a final judgment enforcing all relief granted by the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the satellite carrier may apply within 30 days after such entry to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a judgment reversing the Commission's order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The procedure for an appeal under this paragraph by the satellite carrier shall supersede any other appeal rights under Federal or State law. A United States district court shall be deemed to have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier if the carrier, or a company under common control with the satellite carrier, has delivered television programming by satellite to more than 30 customers in that district during the preceding 4-year period. If the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia does not have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier, an enforcement action or appeal shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which may find personal jurisdiction based on the satellite carrier's ownership of licenses issued by the Commission. An application by a television broadcast station for an order enforcing any cease-and-desist relief granted by the Commission shall be resolved on a highly expedited schedule. No discovery may be conducted by the parties in any such proceeding. The district court shall enforce the Commission order unless the Commission record reflects manifest error and an abuse of discretion by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Civil action for statutory damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after issuance of an order by the Commission under this subsection, a television broadcast station may file a civil action in any United States district court that has personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier for an award of statutory damages for any violation that the Commission has determined to have been committed by a satellite carrier under this subsection. Such action shall not be subject to transfer under section 1404(a) of title 28. On finding that the satellite carrier has committed one or more violations of subsection (b), the District Court shall be required to award the television broadcast station statutory damages of $25,000 per violation, in accordance with paragraph (5), and the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the station. Such statutory damages shall be awarded only if the television broadcast station has filed a binding stipulation with the court that such station will donate the full amount in excess of $1,000 of any statutory damage award to the United States Treasury for public purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a station shall incur no tax liability of any kind with respect to any amounts so donated. Discovery may be conducted by the parties in any proceeding under this paragraph only if and to the extent necessary to resolve a genuinely disputed issue of fact concerning one of the defenses under paragraph (4). In any such action, the defenses under paragraph (4) shall be exclusive, and the burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i). A judgment under this paragraph may be enforced in any manner permissible under Federal or State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Appeals</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The nonprevailing party before a United States district court may appeal a decision under this subsection to the United States Court of Appeals with jurisdiction over that district court. The Court of Appeals shall not issue any stay of the effectiveness of any decision granting relief against a satellite carrier unless the carrier presents clear and convincing evidence that it is highly likely to prevail on appeal and only after posting a bond for the full amount of any monetary award assessed against it and for such further amount as the Court of Appeals may believe appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission denies relief in response to a complaint filed by a television broadcast station under this subsection, the television broadcast station filing the complaint may file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(12) Sunset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No complaint or civil action may be filed under this subsection after December 31, 2001. This subsection shall continue to apply to any complaint or civil action filed on or before such date.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;332. Mobile services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Factors which Commission must consider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In taking actions to manage the spectrum to be made available for use by the private mobile services, the Commission shall consider, consistent with section 151 of this title, whether such actions will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote the safety of life and property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve the efficiency of spectrum use and reduce the regulatory burden upon spectrum users, based upon sound engineering principles, user operational requirements, and marketplace demands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage competition and provide services to the largest feasible number of users; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increase interservice sharing opportunities between private mobile services and other services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Advisory coordinating committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission, in coordinating the assignment of frequencies to stations in the private mobile services and in the fixed services (as defined by the Commission by rule), shall have authority to utilize assistance furnished by advisory coordinating committees consisting of individuals who are not officers or employees of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the Commission established in this subsection shall not be subject to or affected by the provisions of part III of title 5 or section 1342 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who provides assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be considered, by reason of having provided such assistance, a Federal employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any advisory coordinating committee which furnishes assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulatory treatment of mobile services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Common carrier treatment of commercial mobile services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a commercial mobile service shall, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for purposes of this chapter, except for such provisions of subchapter II as the Commission may specify by regulation as inapplicable to that service or person. In prescribing or amending any such regulation, the Commission may not specify any provision of section 201, 202, or 208 of this title, and may specify any other provision only if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations for or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Upon reasonable request of any person providing commercial mobile service, the Commission shall order a common carrier to establish physical connections with such service pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of this title. Except to the extent that the Commission is required to respond to such a request, this subparagraph shall not be construed as a limitation or expansion of the Commission's authority to order interconnection pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) As a part of making a determination with respect to the public interest under subparagraph (A)(iii), the Commission shall consider whether the proposed regulation (or amendment thereof) will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such regulation (or amendment) will enhance competition among providers of commercial mobile services. If the Commission determines that such regulation (or amendment) will promote competition among providers of commercial mobile services, such determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that such regulation (or amendment) is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Commission shall, not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993, complete a rulemaking required to implement this paragraph with respect to the licensing of personal communications services, including making any determinations required by subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Non-common carrier treatment of private mobile services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purpose under this chapter. A common carrier (other than a person that was treated as a provider of a private land mobile service prior to August 10, 1993) shall not provide any dispatch service on any frequency allocated for common carrier service, except to the extent such dispatch service is provided on stations licensed in the domestic public land mobile radio service before January 1, 1982. The Commission may by regulation terminate, in whole or in part, the prohibition contained in the preceding sentence if the Commission determines that such termination will serve the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title, no State or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services. Nothing in this subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services (where such services are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications within such State) from requirements imposed by a State commission on all providers of telecommunications services necessary to ensure the universal availability of telecommunications service at affordable rates. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, a State may petition the Commission for authority to regulate the rates for any commercial mobile service and the Commission shall grant such petition if such State demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) market conditions with respect to such services fail to protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such market conditions exist and such service is a replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the telephone land line exchange service within such State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition. If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such periods of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a State has in effect on June 1, 1993, any regulation concerning the rates for any commercial mobile service offered in such State on such date, such State may, no later than 1 year after August 10, 1993, petition the Commission requesting that the State be authorized to continue exercising authority over such rates. If a State files such a petition, the State's existing regulation shall, notwithstanding subparagraph (A), remain in effect until the Commission completes all action (including any reconsideration) on such petition. The Commission shall review such petition in accordance with the procedures established in such subparagraph, shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) within 12 months after such petition is filed, and shall grant such petition if the State satisfies the showing required under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii). If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such period of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. After a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Commission, has elapsed from the issuance of an order under subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph, any interested party may petition the Commission for an order that the exercise of authority by a State pursuant to such subparagraph is no longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile services are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition in whole or in part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulatory treatment of communications satellite corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter or affect the regulatory treatment required by title IV of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 [47 U.S.C. 741 et seq.] of the corporation authorized by title III of such Act [47 U.S.C. 731 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Space segment capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from continuing to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite systems to providers of commercial mobile services shall be treated as common carriage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Foreign ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission, upon a petition for waiver filed within 6 months after August 10, 1993, may waive the application of section 310(b) of this title to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed before May 24, 1993, of any provider of a private land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, but only upon the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The extent of foreign ownership interest shall not be increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such waiver shall not permit the subsequent transfer of ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Preservation of local zoning authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The regulation of the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities by any State or local government or instrumentality thereof&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A State or local government or instrumentality thereof shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with such government or instrumentality, taking into account the nature and scope of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Any decision by a State or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission's regulations concerning such emissions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) Any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court shall hear and decide such action on an expedited basis. Any person adversely affected by an act or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with clause (iv) may petition the Commission for relief.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &quot;personal wireless services&quot; means commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the term &quot;personal wireless service facilities&quot; means facilities for the provision of personal wireless services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the term &quot;unlicensed wireless service&quot; means the offering of telecommunications services using duly authorized devices which do not require individual licenses, but does not mean the provision of direct-to-home satellite services (as defined in section 303(v) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Mobile services access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of commercial mobile services, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not be required to provide equal access to common carriers for the provision of telephone toll services. If the Commission determines that subscribers to such services are denied access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&apos; choice, and that such denial is contrary to the public interest, convenience, and necessity, then the Commission shall prescribe regulations to afford subscribers unblocked access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&apos; choice through the use of a carrier identification code assigned to such provider or other mechanism. The requirements for unblocking shall not apply to mobile satellite services unless the Commission finds it to be in the public interest to apply such requirements to such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &quot;commercial mobile service&quot; means any mobile service (as defined in section 153 of this title) that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available (A) to the public or (B) to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &quot;interconnected service&quot; means service that is interconnected with the public switched network (as such terms are defined by regulation by the Commission) or service for which a request for interconnection is pending pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &quot;private mobile service&quot; means any mobile service (as defined in section 153 of this title) that is not a commercial mobile service or the functional equivalent of a commercial mobile service, as specified by regulation by the Commission.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission determines to issue additional licenses for advanced television services, the Commission&mdash;</p>

Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7), the Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an application of a licensee of a qualifying low-power television station that is acceptable for filing, award such a class A television station license to such licensee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Resolution of technical problems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall act to preserve the service areas of low-power television licensees pending the final resolution of a class A application. If, after granting certification of eligibility for a class A license, technical problems arise requiring an engineering solution to a full-power station's allotted parameters or channel assignment in the digital television Table of Allotments, the Commission shall make such modifications as necessary&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;338. Carriage of local television signals by satellite carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each satellite carrier providing, under section 122 of title 17, secondary transmissions to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station shall carry upon request the signals of all television broadcast stations located within that local market, subject to section 325(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Remedies for failure to carry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the remedies available to television broadcast stations under section 501(f) of title 17, the Commission may use the Commission's authority under this chapter to assure compliance with the obligations of this subsection, but in no instance shall a Commission enforcement proceeding be required as a predicate to the pursuit of a remedy available under such section 501(f).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Low power station carriage optional</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No low power television station whose signals are provided under section 119(a)(14)&#160;<sup><a href="#338_1_target" name="338_1">1</a></sup> of title 17 shall be entitled to insist on carriage under this section, regardless of whether the satellite carrier provides secondary transmissions of the primary transmissions of other stations in the same local market pursuant to section 122 of such title, nor shall any such carriage be considered in connection with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Carriage of signals of local stations in certain markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A satellite carrier that offers multichannel video programming distribution service in the United States to more than 5,000,000 subscribers shall (A) within 1 year after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as analog signals of each television broadcast station located in any local market within a State that is not part of the contiguous United States, and (B) within 30 months after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as digital signals of each such station. The retransmissions of such stations shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in each station's local market, and the retransmissions of the stations in at least one market in the State shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in areas of the State that are not within a designated market area. The cost to subscribers of such retransmissions shall not exceed the cost of retransmissions of local television stations in other States. Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall promulgate regulations concerning elections by television stations in such State between mandatory carriage pursuant to this section and retransmission consent pursuant to section 325(b) of this title, which shall take into account the schedule on which local television stations are made available to viewers in such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Nondiscrimination in carriage of high definition signals of noncommercial educational television stations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Existing carriage of high definition signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, before the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, an eligible satellite carrier is providing, under section 122 of title 17, any secondary transmissions in high definition format to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station, then such satellite carrier shall carry the signals in high-definition format of qualified noncommercial educational television stations located within that local market in accordance with the following schedule:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) By December 31, 2010, in at least 50 percent of the markets in which such satellite carrier provides such secondary transmissions in high definition format.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) By December 31, 2011, in every market in which such satellite carrier provides such secondary transmissions in high definition format.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) New initiation of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, on or after the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, an eligible satellite carrier initiates the provision, under section 122 of title 17, of any secondary transmissions in high definition format to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station, then such satellite carrier shall carry the signals in high-definition format of all qualified noncommercial educational television stations located within that local market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Good signal required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A television broadcast station asserting its right to carriage under subsection (a) shall be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the designated local receive facility of the satellite carrier or to another facility that is acceptable to at least one-half the stations asserting the right to carriage in the local market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under subsection (g) shall set forth the obligations necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duplication not required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commercial stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a satellite carrier shall not be required to carry upon request the signal of any local commercial television broadcast station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television broadcast station which is secondarily transmitted by the satellite carrier within the same local market, or to carry upon request the signals of more than one local commercial television broadcast station in a single local market that is affiliated with a particular television network unless such stations are licensed to communities in different States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noncommercial stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prescribe regulations limiting the carriage requirements under subsection (a) of satellite carriers with respect to the carriage of multiple local noncommercial television broadcast stations. To the extent possible, such regulations shall provide the same degree of carriage by satellite carriers of such multiple stations as is provided by cable systems under section 535 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No satellite carrier shall be required to provide the signal of a local television broadcast station to subscribers in that station's local market on any particular channel number or to provide the signals in any particular order, except that the satellite carrier shall retransmit the signal of the local television broadcast stations to subscribers in the stations&apos; local market on contiguous channels and provide access to such station's signals at a nondiscriminatory price and in a nondiscriminatory manner on any navigational device, on-screen program guide, or menu.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compensation for carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A satellite carrier shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local television broadcast stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the local receive facility of the satellite carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaints by broadcast stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a local television broadcast station believes that a satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations under subsections (b) through (e) of this section, such station shall notify the carrier, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the satellite carrier failed to comply with such obligations. The satellite carrier shall, within 30 days after such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and comply with such obligations or state its reasons for believing that it is in compliance with such obligations. A local television broadcast station that disputes a response by a satellite carrier that it is in compliance with such obligations may obtain review of such denial or response by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford the satellite carrier against which a complaint is filed under paragraph (1) an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether the satellite carrier has met its obligations under subsections (b) through (e). If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the satellite carrier to take appropriate remedial action. If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has fully met the requirements of such subsections, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Carriage of local stations on a single reception antenna</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Single reception antenna</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each satellite carrier that retransmits the signals of local television broadcast stations in a local market shall retransmit such stations in such market so that a subscriber may receive such stations by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional reception antenna</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the carrier retransmits the signals of local television broadcast stations in a local market in high definition format, the carrier shall retransmit such signals in such market so that a subscriber may receive such signals by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment, but such antenna and associated equipment may be separate from the single reception antenna and associated equipment used to comply with paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Additional notices to subscribers, networks, and stations concerning signal carriage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notices to and elections by subscribers concerning grandfathered signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any carrier that provides a distant signal of a network station to a subscriber pursuant&#160;<sup><a href="#338_2_target" name="338_2">2</a></sup> section 339(a)(2)(A) of this title shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) within 60 days after the local signal of a network station of the same television network is available pursuant to section 338 of this title, or within 60 days after December 8, 2004, whichever is later, send a notice to the subscriber&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) offering to substitute the local network signal for the duplicating distant network signal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) informing the subscriber that, if the subscriber fails to respond in 60 days, the subscriber will lose the distant network signal but will be permitted to subscribe to the local network signal; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Replacement of distant signals with local signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (1), the following rules shall apply after December 8, 2004:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Rules for grandfathered subscribers</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) For those receiving distant signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a subscriber of a satellite carrier who is eligible to receive the signal of a network station solely by reason of section 119(e)&#160;<sup><a href="#339_1_target" name="339_1">1</a></sup> of title 17 (in this subparagraph referred to as a &quot;distant signal&quot;), and who, as of October 1, 2009, is receiving the distant signal of that network station, the following shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) In a case in which the satellite carrier makes available to the subscriber the signal of a local network station affiliated with the same television network pursuant to section 338 of this title, the carrier may only provide the secondary transmissions of the distant signal of a station affiliated with the same network to that subscriber&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) if, within 60 days after receiving the notice of the satellite carrier under section 338(h)(1) of this title, the subscriber elects to retain the distant signal; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) only until such time as the subscriber elects to receive such local signal.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 270 days after the date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, the Commission shall develop and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations, through the use of an antenna, to receive signals in accordance with the signal intensity standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor regulation, including to account for the continuing operation of translator stations and low power television stations. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall rely on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by the Commission in CS Docket No. 98&ndash;201, as previously revised with respect to analog signals, and as recommended by the Commission with respect to digital signals in its Report to Congress in ET Docket No. 05&ndash;182, FCC 05&ndash;199 (released December 9, 2005). The Commission shall establish procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the model by the use of additional data as it becomes available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) On-location testing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall issue an order completing its rulemaking proceeding in ET Docket No. 06&ndash;94 within 270 days after the date of enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010. In conducting such rulemaking, the Commission shall seek ways to minimize consumer burdens associated with on-location testing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Objective verification</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a subscriber's request for a waiver under paragraph (2) is rejected and the subscriber submits to the subscriber's satellite carrier a request for a test verifying the subscriber's inability to receive a signal of the signal intensity referenced in clause (i) of subsection (a)(2)(D), the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited with respect to that subscriber shall select a qualified and independent person to conduct the test referenced in such clause. Such test shall be conducted within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits a request for the test. If the written findings and conclusions of a test conducted in accordance with such clause demonstrate that the subscriber does not receive a signal that meets or exceeds the requisite signal intensity standard in such clause, the subscriber shall not be denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119(d)(10)(A)&#160;<sup><a href="#339_1_target" name="339_1">1</a></sup> of title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Designation of tester and allocation of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited are unable to agree on such a person to conduct the test, the person shall be designated by an independent and neutral entity designated by the Commission by rule. Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test under this paragraph shall be borne by the satellite carrier, if the station's signal meets or exceeds such requisite signal intensity standard, or by the network station, if its signal fails to meet or exceed such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Avoidance of undue burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Commission regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall seek to avoid any undue burden on any party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Reduction of verification burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall by rule exempt from the verification requirements of subparagraph (A) any request for a test made by a subscriber to a satellite carrier to whom the retransmission of the signals of local broadcast stations is available under section 338 of this title from such carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A satellite carrier may refuse to engage in the testing process. If the carrier does so refuse, a subscriber in a local market in which the satellite carrier does not offer the signals of local broadcast stations under section 338 of this title may, at his or her own expense, authorize a signal intensity test to be performed pursuant to the procedures specified by the Commission in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by a tester who is approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test. The tester shall give 5 business days advance written notice to the satellite carrier and to the affected network station or stations. A signal intensity test conducted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be determinative of the signal strength received at that household for purposes of determining whether the household is capable of receiving a signal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (d)(4), for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection, the term &quot;satellite carrier&quot; includes a distributor (as defined in section 119(d)(1) of title 17), but only if the satellite distributor's relationship with the subscriber includes billing, collection, service activation, and service deactivation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) After an order, decision, report, or action has been made or taken in any proceeding by the Commission, or by any designated authority within the Commission pursuant to a delegation under section 155(c)(1) of this title, any party thereto, or any other person aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected thereby, may petition for reconsideration only to the authority making or taking the order, decision, report, or action; and it shall be lawful for such authority, whether it be the Commission or other authority designated under section 155(c)(1) of this title, in its discretion, to grant such a reconsideration if sufficient reason therefor be made to appear. A petition for reconsideration must be filed within thirty days from the date upon which public notice is given of the order, decision, report, or action complained of. No such application shall excuse any person from complying with or obeying any order, decision, report, or action of the Commission, or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof, without the special order of the Commission. The filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not be a condition precedent to judicial review of any such order, decision, report, or action, except where the party seeking such review (1) was not a party to the proceedings resulting in such order, decision, report, or action, or (2) relies on questions of fact or law upon which the Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, has been afforded no opportunity to pass. The Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, shall enter an order, with a concise statement of the reasons therefor, denying a petition for reconsideration or granting such petition, in whole or in part, and ordering such further proceedings as may be appropriate: <i>Provided</i>, That in any case where such petition relates to an instrument of authorization granted without a hearing, the Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, shall take such action within ninety days of the filing of such petition. Reconsiderations shall be governed by such general rules as the Commission may establish, except that no evidence other than newly discovered evidence, evidence which has become available only since the original taking of evidence, or evidence which the Commission or designated authority within the Commission believes should have been taken in the original proceeding shall be taken on any reconsideration. The time within which a petition for review must be filed in a proceeding to which section 402(a) of this title applies, or within which an appeal must be taken under section 402(b) of this title in any case, shall be computed from the date upon which the Commission gives public notice of the order, decision, report, or action complained of.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Pirate radio broadcasting database</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days after January 24, 2020, and semi-annually thereafter, the Commission shall publish a database in a clear and legible format of all licensed radio stations operating in the AM and FM bands. The database shall be easily accessible from the Commission home page through a direct link. The database shall include the following information:</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Policy for Pub. L. 102&ndash;385</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;385, &sect;2(a), (b), Oct. 5, 1992, 106 Stat. 1460, 1463, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 [Pub. L. 98&ndash;549, enacting this subchapter and section 611 of this title, amending sections 152, 224, 309, and 605 of this title, section 2511 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and section 1805 of Title 50, War and National Defense, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 543, 605, and 609 of this title], rates for cable television services have been deregulated in approximately 97 percent of all franchises since December 29, 1986. Since rate deregulation, monthly rates for the lowest priced basic cable service have increased by 40 percent or more for 28 percent of cable television subscribers. Although the average number of basic channels has increased from about 24 to 30, average monthly rates have increased by 29 percent during the same period. The average monthly cable rate has increased almost 3 times as much as the Consumer Price Index since rate deregulation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) For a variety of reasons, including local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area, most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to select between competing cable systems. Without the presence of another multichannel video programming distributor, a cable system faces no local competition. The result is undue market power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and video programmers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) There has been a substantial increase in the penetration of cable television systems over the past decade. Nearly 56,000,000 households, over 60 percent of the households with televisions, subscribe to cable television, and this percentage is almost certain to increase. As a result of this growth, the cable television industry has become a dominant nationwide video medium.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) The cable industry has become highly concentrated. The potential effects of such concentration are barriers to entry for new programmers and a reduction in the number of media voices available to consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) The cable industry has become vertically integrated; cable operators and cable programmers often have common ownership. As a result, cable operators have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated programmers. This could make it more difficult for noncable-affiliated programmers to secure carriage on cable systems. Vertically integrated program suppliers also have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated cable operators over nonaffiliated cable operators and programming distributors using other technologies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in promoting a diversity of views provided through multiple technology media.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in ensuring that cable subscribers have access to local noncommercial educational stations which Congress has authorized, as expressed in section 396(a)(5) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 396(a)(5)]. The distribution of unique noncommercial, educational programming services advances that interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in making all nonduplicative local public television services available on cable systems because&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(A) public television provides educational and informational programming to the Nation's citizens, thereby advancing the Government's compelling interest in educating its citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(B) public television is a local community institution, supported through local tax dollars and voluntary citizen contributions in excess of $10,800,000,000 since 1972, that provides public service programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of the local community;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(C) the Federal Government, in recognition of public television's integral role in serving the educational and informational needs of local communities, has invested more than $3,000,000,000 in public broadcasting since 1969; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&quot;(D) absent carriage requirements there is a substantial likelihood that citizens, who have supported local public television services, will be deprived of those services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in having cable systems carry the signals of local commercial television stations because the carriage of such signals is necessary to serve the goals contained in section 307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 307(b)] of providing a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of broadcast services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) A primary objective and benefit of our Nation's system of regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of programming. There is a substantial governmental interest in ensuring its continuation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) Broadcast television stations continue to be an important source of local news and public affairs programming and other local broadcast services critical to an informed electorate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) Broadcast television programming is supported by revenues generated from advertising broadcast over stations. Such programming is otherwise free to those who own television sets and do not require cable transmission to receive broadcast signals. There is a substantial governmental interest in promoting the continued availability of such free television programming, especially for viewers who are unable to afford other means of receiving programming.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) As a result of the growth of cable television, there has been a marked shift in market share from broadcast television to cable television services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(14) Cable television systems and broadcast television stations increasingly compete for television advertising revenues. As the proportion of households subscribing to cable television increases, proportionately more advertising revenues will be reallocated from broadcast to cable television systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(15) A cable television system which carries the signal of a local television broadcaster is assisting the broadcaster to increase its viewership, and thereby attract additional advertising revenues that otherwise might be earned by the cable system operator. As a result, there is an economic incentive for cable systems to terminate the retransmission of the broadcast signal, refuse to carry new signals, or reposition a broadcast signal to a disadvantageous channel position. There is a substantial likelihood that absent the reimposition of such a requirement, additional local broadcast signals will be deleted, repositioned, or not carried.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(16) As a result of the economic incentive that cable systems have to delete, reposition, or not carry local broadcast signals, coupled with the absence of a requirement that such systems carry local broadcast signals, the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously jeopardized.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(17) Consumers who subscribe to cable television often do so to obtain local broadcast signals which they otherwise would not be able to receive, or to obtain improved signals. Most subscribers to cable television systems do not or cannot maintain antennas to receive broadcast television services, do not have input selector switches to convert from a cable to antenna reception system, or cannot otherwise receive broadcast television services. The regulatory system created by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 was premised upon the continued existence of mandatory carriage obligations for cable systems, ensuring that local stations would be protected from anticompetitive conduct by cable systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(18) Cable television systems often are the single most efficient distribution system for television programming. A Government mandate for a substantial societal investment in alternative distribution systems for cable subscribers, such as the &apos;A/B&apos; input selector antenna system, is not an enduring or feasible method of distribution and is not in the public interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(19) At the same time, broadcast programming that is carried remains the most popular programming on cable systems, and a substantial portion of the benefits for which consumers pay cable systems is derived from carriage of the signals of network affiliates, independent television stations, and public television stations. Also cable programming placed on channels adjacent to popular off-the-air signals obtains a larger audience than on other channel positions. Cable systems, therefore, obtain great benefits from local broadcast signals which, until now, they have been able to obtain without the consent of the broadcaster or any copyright liability. This has resulted in an effective subsidy of the development of cable systems by local broadcasters. While at one time, when cable systems did not attempt to compete with local broadcasters for programming, audience, and advertising, this subsidy may have been appropriate, it is so no longer and results in a competitive imbalance between the 2 industries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(20) The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, in its amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], limited the regulatory authority of franchising authorities over cable operators. Franchising authorities are finding it difficult under the current regulatory scheme to deny renewals to cable systems that are not adequately serving cable subscribers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(21) Cable systems should be encouraged to carry low-power television stations licensed to the communities served by those systems where the low-power station creates and broadcasts, as a substantial part of its programming day, local programming.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Congress in this Act [enacting sections 334, 335, 534 to 537, 544a, 548, and 555a of this title, amending sections 325, 332, 522, 532, 533, 541 to 544, 546, 551 to 555, and 558 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 325, 531, 543, and 554 of this title] to&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) rely on the marketplace, to the maximum extent feasible, to achieve that availability;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;532. Cable channels for commercial use</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to promote competition in the delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that the widest possible diversity of information sources are made available to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent with growth and development of cable systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of channel capacity for commercial use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A cable operator shall designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator in accordance with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An operator of any cable system with 36 or more (but not more than 54) activated channels shall designate 10 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An operator of any cable system with 55 or more (but not more than 100) activated channels shall designate 15 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An operator of any cable system with more than 100 activated channels shall designate 15 percent of all such channels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) An operator of any cable system with fewer than 36 activated channels shall not be required to designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator, unless the cable system is required to provide such channel capacity under the terms of a franchise in effect on October 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) An operator of any cable system in operation on October 30, 1984, shall not be required to remove any service actually being provided on July 1, 1984, in order to comply with this section, but shall make channel capacity available for commercial use as such capacity becomes available until such time as the cable operator is in full compliance with this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not require any cable system to designate channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated persons in excess of the capacity specified in paragraph (1), except as otherwise provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A cable operator may not be required, as part of a request for proposals or as part of a proposal for renewal, subject to section 546 of this title, to designate channel capacity for any use (other than commercial use by unaffiliated persons under this section) except as provided in sections 531 and 557 of this title, but a cable operator may offer in a franchise, or proposal for renewal thereof, to provide, consistent with applicable law, such capacity for other than commercial use by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A cable operator may use any unused channel capacity designated pursuant to this section until the use of such channel capacity is obtained, pursuant to a written agreement, by a person unaffiliated with the operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purposes of this section, the term &quot;commercial use&quot; means the provision of video programming, whether or not for profit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any channel capacity which has been designated for public, educational, or governmental use may not be considered as designated under this section for commercial use for purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of channel capacity by unaffiliated persons; editorial control; restriction on service; rules on rates, terms, and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a person unaffiliated with the cable operator seeks to use channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) for commercial use, the cable operator shall establish, consistent with the purpose of this section and with rules prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (4), the price, terms, and conditions of such use which are at least sufficient to assure that such use will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any video programming provided pursuant to this section, or in any other way consider the content of such programming, except that a cable operator may refuse to transmit any leased access program or portion of a leased access program which contains obscenity, indecency, or nudity and may consider such content to the minimum extent necessary to establish a reasonable price for the commercial use of designated channel capacity by an unaffiliated person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any cable system channel designated in accordance with this section shall not be used to provide a cable service that is being provided over such system on October 30, 1984, if the provision of such programming is intended to avoid the purpose of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Commission shall have the authority to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) determine the maximum reasonable rates that a cable operator may establish pursuant to paragraph (1) for commercial use of designated channel capacity, including the rate charged for the billing of rates to subscribers and for the collection of revenue from subscribers by the cable operator for such use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use, including those for billing and collection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) establish procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall establish rules for determining maximum reasonable rates under subparagraph (A)(i), for establishing terms and conditions under subparagraph (A)(ii), and for providing procedures under subparagraph (A)(iii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Right of action in district court; relief; factors not to be considered by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available for use pursuant to this section may bring an action in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the cable system is located to compel that such capacity be made available. If the court finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or finds that the price, terms, or conditions established by the cable operator are unreasonable, the court may order such system to make available to such person the channel capacity sought, and further determine the appropriate price, terms, or conditions for such use consistent with subsection (c), and may award actual damages if it deems such relief appropriate. In any such action, the court shall not consider any price, term, or condition established between an operator and an affiliate for comparable services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Petition to Commission; relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available pursuant to this section may petition the Commission for relief under this subsection upon a showing of prior adjudicated violations of this section. Records of previous adjudications resulting in a court determination that the operator has violated this section shall be considered as sufficient for the showing necessary under this subsection. If the Commission finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or that the price, terms, or conditions established by such system are unreasonable under subsection (c), the Commission shall, by rule or order, require such operator to make available such channel capacity under price, terms, and conditions consistent with subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by an operator, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that the operator provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by any person who is an operator of more than one cable system, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that such person provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Presumption of reasonableness and good faith</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action brought under this section in any Federal district court or before the Commission, there shall be a presumption that the price, terms, and conditions for use of channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) are reasonable and in good faith unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Promulgation of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding sections 541(c) and 543(a) of this title, at such time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are available to 70 percent of households within the United States and are subscribed to by 70 percent of the households to which such systems are available, the Commission may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources. Any rules promulgated by the Commission pursuant to this subsection shall not preempt authority expressly granted to franchising authorities under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cable service unprotected by Constitution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any cable service offered pursuant to this section shall not be provided, or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable service in the judgment of the franchising authority or the cable operator is obscene, or is in conflict with community standards in that it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States. This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Programming from qualified minority or educational programming sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), a cable operator required by this section to designate channel capacity for commercial use may use any such channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source, whether or not such source is affiliated with the cable operator. The channel capacity used to provide programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 33 percent of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this section. No programming provided over a cable system on July 1, 1990, may qualify as minority programming or educational programming on that cable system under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;qualified minority programming source&quot; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to coverage of minority viewpoints, or to programming directed at members of minority groups, and which is over 50 percent minority-owned, as the term &quot;minority&quot; is defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;qualified educational programming source&quot; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to educational or instructional programming that promotes public understanding of mathematics, the sciences, the humanities, and the arts and has a documented annual expenditure on programming exceeding $15,000,000. The annual expenditure on programming means all annual costs incurred by the programming source to produce or acquire programs which are scheduled to be televised, and specifically excludes marketing, promotion, satellite transmission and operational costs, and general administrative costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall substitute for the requirements to carry qualified noncommercial educational television stations as specified under section 535 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Single channel access to indecent programming</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 120 days following October 5, 1992, the Commission shall promulgate regulations designed to limit the access of children to indecent programming, as defined by Commission regulations, and which cable operators have not voluntarily prohibited under subsection (h) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requiring cable operators to place on a single channel all indecent programs, as identified by program providers, intended for carriage on channels designated for commercial use under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requiring cable operators to block such single channel unless the subscriber requests access to such channel in writing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) requiring programmers to inform cable operators if the program would be indecent as defined by Commission regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Cable operators shall comply with the regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cable operator holding license for multichannel distribution or offering satellite service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for a cable operator to hold a license for multichannel multipoint distribution service, or to offer satellite master antenna television service separate and apart from any franchised cable service, in any portion of the franchise area served by that cable operator's cable system. The Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall waive the requirements of this paragraph for all existing multichannel multipoint distribution services and satellite master antenna television services which are owned by a cable operator on October 5, 1992;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may waive the requirements of this paragraph to the extent the Commission determines is necessary to ensure that all significant portions of a franchise area are able to obtain video programming; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall not apply the requirements of this subsection to any cable operator in any franchise area in which a cable operator is subject to effective competition as determined under section 543(l) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 104&ndash;104, title III, &sect;302(b)(1), Feb. 8, 1996, 110 Stat. 124</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Promulgation of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prescribe rules with respect to the ownership or control of cable systems by persons who own or control other media of mass communications which serve the same community served by a cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulation of ownership by States or franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State or franchising authority may not prohibit the ownership or control of a cable system by any person because of such person's ownership or control of any other media of mass communications or other media interests. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State or franchising authority from prohibiting the ownership or control of a cable system in a jurisdiction by any person (1) because of such person's ownership or control of any other cable system in such jurisdiction; or (2) in circumstances in which the State or franchising authority determines that the acquisition of such a cable system may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Holding of ownership interests or exercise of editorial control by States or franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a State or franchising authority may hold any ownership interest in any cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any State or franchising authority shall not exercise any editorial control regarding the content of any cable service on a cable system in which such governmental entity holds ownership interest (other than programming on any channel designated for educational or governmental use), unless such control is exercised through an entity separate from the franchising authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enhancement of effective competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to enhance effective competition, the Commission shall, within one year after October 5, 1992, conduct a proceeding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through cable systems owned by such person, or in which such person has an attributable interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that can be occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing limitations on the degree to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing rules and regulations under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, among other public interest objectives&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that no cable operator or group of cable operators can unfairly impede, either because of the size of any individual operator or because of joint actions by a group of operators of sufficient size, the flow of video programming from the video programmer to the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that cable operators affiliated with video programmers do not favor such programmers in determining carriage on their cable systems or do not unreasonably restrict the flow of the video programming of such programmers to other video distributors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take particular account of the market structure, ownership patterns, and other relationships of the cable television industry, including the nature and market power of the local franchise, the joint ownership of cable systems and video programmers, and the various types of non-equity controlling interests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) account for any efficiencies and other benefits that might be gained through increased ownership or control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) make such rules and regulations reflect the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) not impose limitations which would bar cable operators from serving previously unserved rural areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) not impose limitations which would impair the development of diverse and high quality video programming.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Combination of interests under prior law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to prohibit any combination of any interests held by any person on July 1, 1984, to the extent of the interests so held as of such date, if the holding of such interests was not inconsistent with any applicable Federal or State law or regulations in effect on that date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &quot;Media of mass communications&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;media of mass communications&quot; shall have the meaning given such term under section 309(i)(3)(C)(i) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;534. Carriage of local commercial television signals</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cable operator shall carry, on the cable system of that operator, the signals of local commercial television stations and qualified low power stations as provided by this section. Carriage of additional broadcast television signals on such system shall be at the discretion of such operator, subject to section 325(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Signals required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall carry the signals of at least three local commercial television stations, except that if such a system has 300 or fewer subscribers, it shall not be subject to any requirements under this section so long as such system does not delete from carriage by that system any signal of a broadcast television station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A cable operator of a cable system with more than 12 usable activated channels shall carry the signals of local commercial television stations, up to one-third of the aggregate number of usable activated channels of such system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection of signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the number of local commercial television stations exceeds the maximum number of signals a cable system is required to carry under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall have discretion in selecting which such stations shall be carried on its cable system, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under no circumstances shall a cable operator carry a qualified low power station in lieu of a local commercial television station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the cable operator elects to carry an affiliate of a broadcast network (as such term is defined by the Commission by regulation), such cable operator shall carry the affiliate of such broadcast network whose city of license reference point, as defined in section 76.53 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulation thereto, is closest to the principal headend of the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Content to be carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator shall carry in its entirety, on the cable system of that operator, the primary video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission of each of the local commercial television stations carried on the cable system and, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the vertical blanking interval or on subcarriers. Retransmission of other material in the vertical blanking internal or other nonprogram-related material (including teletext and other subscription and advertiser-supported information services) shall be at the discretion of the cable operator. Where appropriate and feasible, operators may delete signal enhancements, such as ghost-canceling, from the broadcast signal and employ such enhancements at the system headend or headends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The cable operator shall carry the entirety of the program schedule of any television station carried on the cable system unless carriage of specific programming is prohibited, and other programming authorized to be substituted, under section 76.67 or subpart F of part 76 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulations thereto.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Signal quality</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nondegradation; technical specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The signals of local commercial television stations that a cable operator carries shall be carried without material degradation. The Commission shall adopt carriage standards to ensure that, to the extent technically feasible, the quality of signal processing and carriage provided by a cable system for the carriage of local commercial television stations will be no less than that provided by the system for carriage of any other type of signal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Advanced television</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At such time as the Commission prescribes modifications of the standards for television broadcast signals, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to establish any changes in the signal carriage requirements of cable television systems necessary to ensure cable carriage of such broadcast signals of local commercial television stations which have been changed to conform with such modified standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duplication not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any local commercial television station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station which is carried on its cable system, or to carry the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network (as such term is defined by regulation). If a cable operator elects to carry on its cable system a signal which substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station carried on the cable system, or to carry on its system the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network, all such signals shall be counted toward the number of signals the operator is required to carry under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the local commercial television station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or on the channel on which it was carried on January 1, 1992, at the election of the station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator. Any dispute regarding the positioning of a local commercial television station shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Signal availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system. Such signals shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which a cable operator provides a connection. If a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections, but does not provide the subscriber with such connections, or with the equipment and materials for such connections, the operator shall notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable without a converter box and shall offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such subscribers at rates in accordance with section 543(b)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Identification of signals carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person, the signals carried on its system in fulfillment of the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall provide written notice to a local commercial television station at least 30 days prior to either deleting from carriage or repositioning that station. The notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Compensation for carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local commercial television stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for the channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the principal headend of the cable system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator may accept payments from stations which would be considered distant signals under section 111 of title 17 as indemnification for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage of such signal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a cable operator may continue to accept monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage or channel positioning of the signal of any local commercial television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section, through, but not beyond, the date of expiration of an agreement thereon between a cable operator and a local commercial television station entered into prior to June 26, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Low power station carriage obligation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there are not sufficient signals of full power local commercial television stations to fill the channels set aside under subsection (b)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of 35 or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry one qualified low power station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of more than 35 usable activated channels shall be required to carry two qualified low power stations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of public, educational, or governmental channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator required to carry more than one signal of a qualified low power station under this subsection may do so, subject to approval by the franchising authority pursuant to section 531 of this title, by placing such additional station on public, educational, or governmental channels not in use for their designated purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaints by broadcast stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a local commercial television station believes that a cable operator has failed to meet its obligations under this section, such station shall notify the operator, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the cable operator is obligated to carry the signal of such station or has otherwise failed to comply with the channel positioning or repositioning or other requirements of this section. The cable operator shall, within 30 days of such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and either commence to carry the signal of such station in accordance with the terms requested or state its reasons for believing that it is not obligated to carry such signal or is in compliance with the channel positioning and repositioning and other requirements of this section. A local commercial television station that is denied carriage or channel positioning or repositioning in accordance with this section by a cable operator may obtain review of such denial by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable operator has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed, the Commission shall determine whether the cable operator has met its obligations under this section. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the cable operator to reposition the complaining station or, in the case of an obligation to carry a station, to commence carriage of the station and to continue such carriage for at least 12 months. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has fully met the requirements of this section, it shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Input selector switch rules abolished</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No cable operator shall be required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide or make available any input selector switch as defined in section 76.5(mm) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any comparable device; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide information to subscribers about input selector switches or comparable devices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, following a rulemaking proceeding, issue regulations implementing the requirements imposed by this section. Such implementing regulations shall include necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sales presentations and program length commercials</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Carriage pending proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending the outcome of the proceeding under paragraph (2), nothing in this chapter shall require a cable operator to carry on any tier, or prohibit a cable operator from carrying on any tier, the signal of any commercial television station or video programming service that is predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proceeding concerning certain stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 270 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission, notwithstanding prior proceedings to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, shall complete a proceeding in accordance with this paragraph to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In conducting such proceeding, the Commission shall provide appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. The Commission shall consider the viewing of such stations, the level of competing demands for the spectrum allocated to such stations, and the role of such stations in providing competition to nonbroadcast services offering similar programming. In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall qualify such stations as local commercial television stations for purposes of subsection (a). In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are not serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall allow the licensees of such stations a reasonable period within which to provide different programming, and shall not deny such stations a renewal expectancy solely because their programming consisted predominantly of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Definitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Local commercial television station</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;local commercial television station&quot; means any full power television broadcast station, other than a qualified noncommercial educational television station within the meaning of section 535(l)(1) of this title, licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by the Commission that, with respect to a particular cable system, is within the same television market as the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &quot;local commercial television station&quot; shall not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) low power television stations, television translator stations, and passive repeaters which operate pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulations thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a television broadcast station that would be considered a distant signal under section 111 of title 17, if such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage on the cable system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a television broadcast station that does not deliver to the principal headend of a cable system either a signal level of &#8722;45dBm for UHF signals or &#8722;49dBm for VHF signals at the input terminals of the signal processing equipment, if such station does not agree to be responsible for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Market determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of this section, a broadcasting station's market shall be determined by the Commission by regulation or order using, where available, commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns, except that, following a written request, the Commission may, with respect to a particular television broadcast station, include additional communities within its television market or exclude communities from such station's television market to better effectuate the purposes of this section. In considering such requests, the Commission may determine that particular communities are part of more than one television market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In considering requests filed pursuant to clause (i), the Commission shall afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account such factors as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) whether the station, or other stations located in the same area, have been historically carried on the cable system or systems within such community or on the satellite carrier or carriers serving such community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) whether modifying the market of the television station would promote consumers&apos; access to television broadcast station signals that originate in their State of residence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a cable system in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(V) evidence of viewing patterns in households that subscribe and do not subscribe to the services offered by multichannel video programming distributors within the areas served by such multichannel video programming distributors in such community.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) A cable operator shall not delete from carriage the signal of a commercial television station during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Within 120 days after the date on which a request is filed under this subparagraph (or 120 days after February 8, 1996, if later), the Commission shall grant or deny the request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified low power station</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &quot;qualified low power station&quot; means any television broadcast station conforming to the rules established for Low Power Television Stations contained in part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such station broadcasts for at least the minimum number of hours of operation required by the Commission for television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such station meets all obligations and requirements applicable to television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to the broadcast of nonentertainment programming; programming and rates involving political candidates, election issues, controversial issues of public importance, editorials, and personal attacks; programming for children; and equal employment opportunity; and the Commission determines that the provision of such programming by such station would address local news and informational needs which are not being adequately served by full power television broadcast stations because of the geographic distance of such full power stations from the low power station's community of license;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such station complies with interference regulations consistent with its secondary status pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such station is located no more than 35 miles from the cable system's headend, and delivers to the principal headend of the cable system an over-the-air signal of good quality, as determined by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the community of license of such station and the franchise area of the cable system are both located outside of the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, ranked by population, as determined by the Office of Management and Budget on June 30, 1990, and the population of such community of license on such date did not exceed 35,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) there is no full power television broadcast station licensed to any community within the county or other political subdivision (of a State) served by the cable system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the secondary status of any low power station as provided in part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on October 5, 1992.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the carriage requirements set forth in section 534 of this title, each cable operator of a cable system shall carry the signals of qualified noncommercial educational television stations in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements to carry qualified stations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General requirement to carry each qualified station</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) and subsection (e), each cable operator shall carry, on the cable system of that cable operator, any qualified local noncommercial educational television station requesting carriage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Systems with 12 or fewer channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry the signal of one qualified local noncommercial educational television station; except that a cable operator of such a system shall comply with subsection (c) and may, in its discretion, carry the signals of other qualified noncommercial educational television stations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of a cable system described in subparagraph (A) which operates beyond the presence of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the cable operator shall import and carry on that system the signal of one qualified noncommercial educational television station;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the selection for carriage of such a signal shall be at the election of the cable operator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in order to satisfy the requirements for carriage specified in this subsection, the cable operator of the system shall not be required to remove any other programming service actually provided to subscribers on March 29, 1990; except that such cable operator shall use the first channel available to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Systems with 13 to 36 channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subsection (c), a cable operator of a cable system with 13 to 36 usable activated channels&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall carry the signal of at least one qualified local noncommercial educational television station but shall not be required to carry the signals of more than three such stations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) may, in its discretion, carry additional such stations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of a cable system described in this paragraph which operates beyond the presence of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station, the cable operator shall import and carry on that system the signal of at least one qualified noncommercial educational television station to comply with subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The cable operator of a cable system described in this paragraph which carries the signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational station affiliated with a State public television network shall not be required to carry the signal of any additional qualified local noncommercial educational television stations affiliated with the same network if the programming of such additional stations is substantially duplicated by the programming of the qualified local noncommercial educational television station receiving carriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A cable operator of a system described in this paragraph which increases the usable activated channel capacity of the system to more than 36 channels on or after March 29, 1990, shall, in accordance with the other provisions of this section, carry the signal of each qualified local noncommercial educational television station requesting carriage, subject to subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Continued carriage of existing stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, all cable operators shall continue to provide carriage to all qualified local noncommercial educational television stations whose signals were carried on their systems as of March 29, 1990. The requirements of this subsection may be waived with respect to a particular cable operator and a particular such station, upon the written consent of the cable operator and the station.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Placement of additional signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator required to add the signals of qualified local noncommercial educational television stations to a cable system under this section may do so, subject to approval by the franchising authority pursuant to section 531 of this title, by placing such additional stations on public, educational, or governmental channels not in use for their designated purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Systems with more than 36 channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of more than 36 usable activated channels which is required to carry the signals of three qualified local noncommercial educational television stations shall not be required to carry the signals of additional such stations the programming of which substantially duplicates the programming broadcast by another qualified local noncommercial educational television station requesting carriage. Substantial duplication shall be defined by the Commission in a manner that promotes access to distinctive noncommercial educational television services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Waiver of nonduplication rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A qualified local noncommercial educational television station whose signal is carried by a cable operator shall not assert any network nonduplication rights it may have pursuant to section 76.92 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, to require the deletion of programs aired on other qualified local noncommercial educational television stations whose signals are carried by that cable operator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Conditions of carriage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Content to be carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall retransmit in its entirety the primary video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission of each qualified local noncommercial educational television station whose signal is carried on the cable system, and, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the vertical blanking interval, or on subcarriers, that may be necessary for receipt of programming by handicapped persons or for educational or language purposes. Retransmission of other material in the vertical blanking interval or on subcarriers shall be within the discretion of the cable operator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bandwidth and technical quality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall provide each qualified local noncommercial educational television station whose signal is carried in accordance with this section with bandwidth and technical capacity equivalent to that provided to commercial television broadcast stations carried on the cable system and shall carry the signal of each qualified local noncommercial educational television station without material degradation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Changes in carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station shall not be repositioned by a cable operator unless the cable operator, at least 30 days in advance of such repositioning, has provided written notice to the station and all subscribers of the cable system. For purposes of this paragraph, repositioning includes (A) assignment of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station to a cable system channel number different from the cable system channel number to which the station was assigned as of March 29, 1990, and (B) deletion of the station from the cable system. The notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Good quality signal required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a cable operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station which does not deliver to the cable system's principal headend a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal, as may be defined by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the qualified local noncommercial educational television station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, at the election of the station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator. Any dispute regarding the positioning of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Availability of signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Signals carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be available to every subscriber as part of the cable system's lowest priced service tier that includes the retransmission of local commercial television broadcast signals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Payment for carriage prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall not accept monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage of the signal of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section, except that such a station may be required to bear the cost associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the principal headend of the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distant signal exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a cable operator shall not be required to add the signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station not already carried under the provision of subsection (c), where such signal would be considered a distant signal for copyright purposes unless such station indemnifies the cable operator for any increased copyright costs resulting from carriage of such signal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a qualified local noncommercial educational television station believes that a cable operator of a cable system has failed to comply with the signal carriage requirements of this section, the station may file a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable operator has failed to comply with such requirements and state the basis for such allegations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments to establish that the cable operator has complied with the signal carriage requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under this subsection, the Commission shall determine whether the cable operator has complied with the requirements of this section. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has failed to comply with such requirements, the Commission shall state with particularity the basis for such findings and order the cable operator to take such remedial action as is necessary to meet such requirements. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has fully complied with such requirements, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Identification of signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person, those signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(l) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;543. Regulation of rates</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Competition preference; local and Federal regulation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No Federal agency or State may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service except to the extent provided under this section and section 532 of this title. Any franchising authority may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service, or any other communications service provided over a cable system to cable subscribers, but only to the extent provided under this section. No Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may regulate the rates for cable service of a cable system that is owned or operated by a local government or franchising authority within whose jurisdiction that cable system is located and that is the only cable system located within such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preference for competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission finds that a cable system is subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable service by such system shall not be subject to regulation by the Commission or by a State or franchising authority under this section. If the Commission finds that a cable system is not subject to effective competition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for the provision of basic cable service shall be subject to regulation by a franchising authority, or by the Commission if the Commission exercises jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (6), in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rates for cable programming services shall be subject to regulation by the Commission under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualification of franchising authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A franchising authority that seeks to exercise the regulatory jurisdiction permitted under paragraph (2)(A) shall file with the Commission a written certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority will adopt and administer regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority has the legal authority to adopt, and the personnel to administer, such regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Approval by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification filed by a franchising authority under paragraph (3) shall be effective 30 days after the date on which it is filed unless the Commission finds, after notice to the authority and a reasonable opportunity for the authority to comment, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority has adopted or is administering regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are not consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority does not have the legal authority to adopt, or the personnel to administer, such regulations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority do not provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification, the Commission shall notify the franchising authority of any revisions or modifications necessary to obtain approval.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation of jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon petition by a cable operator or other interested party, the Commission shall review the regulation of cable system rates by a franchising authority under this subsection. A copy of the petition shall be provided to the franchising authority by the person filing the petition. If the Commission finds that the franchising authority has acted inconsistently with the requirements of this subsection, the Commission shall grant appropriate relief. If the Commission, after the franchising authority has had a reasonable opportunity to comment, determines that the State and local laws and regulations are not in conformance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b), the Commission shall revoke the jurisdiction of such authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exercise of jurisdiction by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification under paragraph (4), or revokes such authority's jurisdiction under paragraph (5), the Commission shall exercise the franchising authority's regulatory jurisdiction under paragraph (2)(A) until the franchising authority has qualified to exercise that jurisdiction by filing a new certification that meets the requirements of paragraph (3). Such new certification shall be effective upon approval by the Commission. The Commission shall act to approve or disapprove any such new certification within 90 days after the date it is filed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Aggregation of equipment costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall allow cable operators, pursuant to any rules promulgated under subsection (b)(3), to aggregate, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level, their equipment costs into broad categories, such as converter boxes, regardless of the varying levels of functionality of the equipment within each such broad category. Such aggregation shall not be permitted with respect to equipment used by subscribers who receive only a rate regulated basic service tier.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revision to Commission rules; forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 120 days of February 8, 1996, the Commission shall issue revisions to the appropriate rules and forms necessary to implement subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of basic service tier rate regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission obligation to subscribers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, by regulation, ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable. Such regulations shall be designed to achieve the goal of protecting subscribers of any cable system that is not subject to effective competition from rates for the basic service tier that exceed the rates that would be charged for the basic service tier if such cable system were subject to effective competition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe, and periodically thereafter revise, regulations to carry out its obligations under paragraph (1). In prescribing such regulations, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall seek to reduce the administrative burdens on subscribers, cable operators, franchising authorities, and the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may adopt formulas or other mechanisms and procedures in complying with the requirements of subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall take into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the direct costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing signals carried on the basic service tier, including signals and services carried on the basic service tier pursuant to paragraph (7)(B), and changes in such costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) only such portion of the joint and common costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing such signals as is determined, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to be reasonably and properly allocable to the basic service tier, and changes in such costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the basic service tier or from other consideration obtained in connection with the basic service tier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the reasonably and properly allocable portion of any amount assessed as a franchise fee, tax, or charge of any kind imposed by any State or local authority on the transactions between cable operators and cable subscribers or any other fee, tax, or assessment of general applicability imposed by a governmental entity applied against cable operators or cable subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) any amount required, in accordance with paragraph (4), to satisfy franchise requirements to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) a reasonable profit, as defined by the Commission consistent with the Commission's obligations to subscribers under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to establish, on the basis of actual cost, the price or rate for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) installation and lease of the equipment used by subscribers to receive the basic service tier, including a converter box and a remote control unit and, if requested by the subscriber, such addressable converter box or other equipment as is required to access programming described in paragraph (8); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) installation and monthly use of connections for additional television receivers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Costs of franchise requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to identify costs attributable to satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Implementation and enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include additional standards, guidelines, and procedures concerning the implementation and enforcement of such regulations, which shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) procedures by which cable operators may implement and franchising authorities may enforce the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) procedures for the expeditious resolution of disputes between cable operators and franchising authorities concerning the administration of such regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) standards and procedures to prevent unreasonable charges for changes in the subscriber's selection of services or equipment subject to regulation under this section, which standards shall require that charges for changing the service tier selected shall be based on the cost of such change and shall not exceed nominal amounts when the system's configuration permits changes in service tier selection to be effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple method; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) standards and procedures to assure that subscribers receive notice of the availability of the basic service tier required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The procedures prescribed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (5)(A) shall require a cable operator to provide 30 days&apos; advance notice to a franchising authority of any increase proposed in the price to be charged for the basic service tier.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Components of basic tier subject to rate regulation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Minimum contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each cable operator of a cable system shall provide its subscribers a separately available basic service tier to which subscription is required for access to any other tier of service. Such basic service tier shall, at a minimum, consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) All signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of sections 534 and 535 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Any public, educational, and governmental access programming required by the franchise of the cable system to be provided to subscribers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Any signal of any television broadcast station that is provided by the cable operator to any subscriber, except a signal which is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier beyond the local service area of such station.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Permitted additions to basic tier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may add additional video programming signals or services to the basic service tier. Any such additional signals or services provided on the basic service tier shall be provided to subscribers at rates determined under the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Buy-through of other tiers prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may not require the subscription to any tier other than the basic service tier required by paragraph (7) as a condition of access to video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. A cable operator may not discriminate between subscribers to the basic service tier and other subscribers with regard to the rates charged for video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception; limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prohibition in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a cable system that, by reason of the lack of addressable converter boxes or other technological limitations, does not permit the operator to offer programming on a per channel or per program basis in the same manner required by subparagraph (A). This subparagraph shall not be available to any cable operator after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the technology utilized by the cable system is modified or improved in a way that eliminates such technological limitation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 10 years after October 5, 1992, subject to subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in any proceeding initiated at the request of any cable operator, the Commission determines that compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (A) would require the cable operator to increase its rates, the Commission may, to the extent consistent with the public interest, grant such cable operator a waiver from such requirements for such specified period as the Commission determines reasonable and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulation of unreasonable rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) criteria prescribed in accordance with paragraph (2) for identifying, in individual cases, rates for cable programming services that are unreasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fair and expeditious procedures for the receipt, consideration, and resolution of complaints from any franchising authority (in accordance with paragraph (3)) alleging that a rate for cable programming services charged by a cable operator violates the criteria prescribed under subparagraph (A), which procedures shall include the minimum showing that shall be required for a complaint to obtain Commission consideration and resolution of whether the rate in question is unreasonable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the procedures to be used to reduce rates for cable programming services that are determined by the Commission to be unreasonable and to refund such portion of the rates or charges that were paid by subscribers after the filing of the first complaint filed with the franchising authority under paragraph (3) and that are determined to be unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the criteria for determining in individual cases whether rates for cable programming services are unreasonable under paragraph (1)(A), the Commission shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for similarly situated cable systems offering comparable cable programming services, taking into account similarities in facilities, regulatory and governmental costs, the number of subscribers, and other relevant factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the history of the rates for cable programming services of the system, including the relationship of such rates to changes in general consumer prices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the rates, as a whole, for all the cable programming, cable equipment, and cable services provided by the system, other than programming provided on a per channel or per program basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) capital and operating costs of the cable system, including the quality and costs of the customer service provided by the cable system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the service for which a rate is being established, and changes in such revenues, or from other consideration obtained in connection with the cable programming services concerned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review of rate changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall review any complaint submitted by a franchising authority after February 8, 1996, concerning an increase in rates for cable programming services and issue a final order within 90 days after it receives such a complaint, unless the parties agree to extend the period for such review. A franchising authority may not file a complaint under this paragraph unless, within 90 days after such increase becomes effective it receives subscriber complaints.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sunset of upper tier rate regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to cable programming services provided after March 31, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Uniform rate structure required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall have a rate structure, for the provision of cable service, that is uniform throughout the geographic area in which cable service is provided over its cable system. This subsection does not apply to (1) a cable operator with respect to the provision of cable service over its cable system in any geographic area in which the video programming services offered by the operator in that area are subject to effective competition, or (2) any video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. Bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units shall not be subject to this subsection, except that a cable operator of a cable system that is not subject to effective competition may not charge predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit. Upon a prima facie showing by a complainant that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discounted price is predatory, the cable system shall have the burden of showing that its discounted price is not predatory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Discrimination; services for the hearing impaired</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting any Federal agency, State, or a franchising authority from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prohibiting discrimination among subscribers and potential subscribers to cable service, except that no Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may prohibit a cable operator from offering reasonable discounts to senior citizens or other economically disadvantaged group discounts; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring and regulating the installation or rental of equipment which facilitates the reception of cable service by hearing impaired individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Negative option billing prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, by regulation, require cable operators to file with the Commission or a franchising authority, as appropriate, within one year after October 5, 1992, and annually thereafter, such financial information as may be needed for purposes of administering and enforcing this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prevention of evasions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish standards, guidelines, and procedures to prevent evasions, including evasions that result from retiering, of the requirements of this section and shall, thereafter, periodically review and revise such standards, guidelines, and procedures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Small system burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing and prescribing regulations pursuant to this section, the Commission shall design such regulations to reduce the administrative burdens and cost of compliance for cable systems that have 1,000 or fewer subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Rate regulation agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the term of an agreement made before July 1, 1990, by a franchising authority and a cable operator providing for the regulation of basic cable service rates, where there was not effective competition under Commission rules in effect on that date, nothing in this section (or the regulations thereunder) shall abridge the ability of such franchising authority to regulate rates in accordance with such an agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports on average prices</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall publish with its report under section 163 of this title statistical reports on the average rates for basic cable service and other cable programming, and for converter boxes, remote control units, and other equipment of cable systems that the Commission has found are subject to effective competition under subsection (a)(2) compared with cable systems that the Commission has found are not subject to such effective competition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inclusion in report</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall include in its report under paragraph (1) the aggregate average total amount paid by cable systems in compensation under section 325 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Form</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall publish information under this paragraph in a manner substantially similar to the way other comparable information is published in such report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(l) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &quot;effective competition&quot; means that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) fewer than 30 percent of the households in the franchise area subscribe to the cable service of a cable system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchise area is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) served by at least two unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors each of which offers comparable video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in the franchise area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the number of households subscribing to programming services offered by multichannel video programming distributors other than the largest multichannel video programming distributor exceeds 15 percent of the households in the franchise area;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a multichannel video programming distributor operated by the franchising authority for that franchise area offers video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in that franchise area; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a local exchange carrier or its affiliate (or any multichannel video programming distributor using the facilities of such carrier or its affiliate) offers video programming services directly to subscribers by any means (other than direct-to-home satellite services) in the franchise area of an unaffiliated cable operator which is providing cable service in that franchise area, but only if the video programming services so offered in that area are comparable to the video programming services provided by the unaffiliated cable operator in that area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &quot;cable programming service&quot; means any video programming provided over a cable system, regardless of service tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such video programming, other than (A) video programming carried on the basic service tier, and (B) video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Special rules for small companies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to a small cable operator with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) cable programming services, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a basic service tier that was the only service tier subject to regulation as of December 31, 1994,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in any franchise area in which that operator services 50,000 or fewer subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &quot;Small cable operator&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;small cable operator&quot; means a cable operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Treatment of prior year losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of section 532 of this title, losses associated with a cable system (including losses associated with the grant or award of a franchise) that were incurred prior to September 4, 1992, with respect to a cable system that is owned and operated by the original franchisee of such system shall not be disallowed, in whole or in part, in the determination of whether the rates for any tier of service or any type of equipment that is subject to regulation under this section are lawful.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(o) Streamlined petition process for small cable operators</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 180 days after December 4, 2014, the Commission shall complete a rulemaking to establish a streamlined process for filing of an effective competition petition pursuant to this section for small cable operators, particularly those who serve primarily rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to have any effect on the duty of a small cable operator to prove the existence of effective competition under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition of small cable operator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &quot;small cable operator&quot; has the meaning given the term in subsection (m)(2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cable service unprotected by Constitution; blockage of premium channel upon request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting a franchising authority and a cable operator from specifying, in a franchise or renewal thereof, that certain cable services shall not be provided or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable services are obscene or are otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to restrict the viewing of of of&#160;<sup><a href="#544_1_target" name="544_1">1</a></sup> programming which is obscene or indecent, upon the request of a subscriber, a cable operator shall provide (by sale or lease) a device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing of a particular cable service during periods selected by that subscriber.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a cable operator provides a premium channel without charge to cable subscribers who do not subscribe to such premium channel, the cable operator shall, not later than 30 days before such premium channel is provided without charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) notify all cable subscribers that the cable operator plans to provide a premium channel without charge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notify all cable subscribers when the cable operator plans to offer a premium channel without charge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) notify all cable subscribers that they have a right to request that the channel carrying the premium channel be blocked; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) block the channel carrying the premium channel upon the request of a subscriber.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purpose of this section, the term &quot;premium channel&quot; shall mean any pay service offered on a per channel or per program basis, which offers movies rated by the Motion Picture Association of America as X, NC&ndash;17, or R.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Technical standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within one year after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe regulations which establish minimum technical standards relating to cable systems&apos; technical operation and signal quality.

No State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type of subscriber equipment or any transmission technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on regulatory powers of Federal agencies, States, or franchising authorities; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not impose requirements regarding the provision or content of cable services, except as expressly provided in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any rule, regulation, or order issued under any Federal law, as such rule, regulation, or order (i) was in effect on September 21, 1983, or (ii) may be amended after such date if the rule, regulation, or order as amended is not inconsistent with the express provisions of this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any rule, regulation, or order under title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Access to emergency information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any such rule, regulation, or order, each cable operator shall comply with such standards as the Commission shall prescribe to ensure that viewers of video programming on cable systems are afforded the same emergency information as is afforded by the emergency broadcasting system pursuant to Commission regulations in subpart G of part 73, title 47, Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Notice of changes in and comments on services</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;544a. Consumer electronics equipment compatibility</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) new and recent models of television receivers and video cassette recorders often contain premium features and functions that are disabled or inhibited because of cable scrambling, encoding, or encryption technologies and devices, including converter boxes and remote control devices required by cable operators to receive programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if these problems are allowed to persist, consumers will be less likely to purchase, and electronics equipment manufacturers will be less likely to develop, manufacture, or offer for sale, television receivers and video cassette recorders with new and innovative features and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) cable operators should use technologies that will prevent signal thefts while permitting consumers to benefit from such features and functions in such receivers and recorders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) compatibility among televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems can be assured with narrow technical standards that mandate a minimum degree of common design and operation, leaving all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options for selection through open competition in the market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compatible interfaces</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall issue such regulations as are necessary to assure compatibility between televisions and video cassette recorders and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable systems and the functions available on their televisions and video cassette recorders.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scrambling and encryption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing the regulations referred to in paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether and, if so, under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict cable systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals, except that the Commission shall not limit the use of scrambling or encryption technology where the use of such technology does not interfere with the functions of subscribers&apos; television receivers or video cassette recorders.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rulemaking requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing the regulations required by this section, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need to maximize open competition in the market for all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options of converter boxes and other cable converters unrelated to the descrambling or decryption of cable television signals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the costs and benefits to consumers of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators and television manufacturers in a manner that, while providing effective protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable service, will minimize interference with or nullification of the special functions of subscribers&apos; television receivers or video cassette recorders, including functions that permit the subscriber&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or to protect such signals against unauthorized reception.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section shall include such regulations as are necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to specify the technical requirements with which a television receiver or video cassette recorder must comply in order to be sold as &quot;cable compatible&quot; or &quot;cable ready&quot;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to require cable operators offering channels whose reception requires a converter box&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may be unable to benefit from the special functions of their television receivers and video cassette recorders, including functions that permit subscribers&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent technically and economically feasible, to offer subscribers the option of having all other channels delivered directly to the subscribers&apos; television receivers or video cassette recorders without passing through the converter box;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote the commercial availability, from cable operators and retail vendors that are not affiliated with cable systems, of converter boxes and of remote control devices compatible with converter boxes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to ensure that any standards or regulations developed under the authority of this section to ensure compatibility between televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems do not affect features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options other than those specified in paragraph (1)(B), including telecommunications interface equipment, home automation communications, and computer network services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to require a cable operator who offers subscribers the option of renting a remote control unit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may purchase a commercially available remote control device from any source that sells such devices rather than renting it from the cable operator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to specify the types of remote control units that are compatible with the converter box supplied by the cable operator; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to prohibit a cable operator from taking any action that prevents or in any way disables the converter box supplied by the cable operator from operating compatibly with commercially available remote control units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall periodically review and, if necessary, modify the regulations issued pursuant to this section in light of any actions taken in response to such regulations and to reflect improvements and changes in cable systems, television receivers, video cassette recorders, and similar technology.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;545. Modification of franchise obligations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grounds for modification by franchising authority; public proceeding; time of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the period a franchise is in effect, the cable operator may obtain from the franchising authority modifications of the requirements in such franchise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of any such requirement for facilities or equipment, including public, educational, or governmental access facilities or equipment, if the cable operator demonstrates that (i) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement, and (ii) the proposal by the cable operator for modification of such requirement is appropriate because of commercial impracticability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any such requirement for services, if the cable operator demonstrates that the mix, quality, and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any final decision by a franchising authority under this subsection shall be made in a public proceeding. Such decision shall be made within 120 days after receipt of such request by the franchising authority, unless such 120 day period is extended by mutual agreement of the cable operator and the franchising authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial proceedings; grounds for modification by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cable operator whose request for modification under subsection (a) has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority may obtain modification of such franchise requirements pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for facilities or equipment, the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the terms of the modification requested are appropriate because of commercial impracticability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for services, the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that the mix, quality, and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rearrangement, replacement, or removal of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a cable operator may, upon 30 days&apos; advance notice to the franchising authority, rearrange, replace, or remove a particular cable service required by the franchise if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such service is no longer available to the operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such service is available to the operator only upon the payment of a royalty required under section 801(b)(2) of title 17, which the cable operator can document&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is substantially in excess of the amount of such payment required on the date of the operator's offer to provide such service, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has not been specifically compensated for through a rate increase or other adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rearrangement of particular services from one service tier to another or other offering of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a cable operator may take such actions to rearrange a particular service from one service tier to another, or otherwise offer the service, if the rates for all of the service tiers involved in such actions are not subject to regulation under section 543 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Requirements for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator may not obtain modification under this section of any requirement for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &quot;Commercially impracticable&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;commercially impracticable&quot; means, with respect to any requirement applicable to a cable operator, that it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement as a result of a change in conditions which is beyond the control of the operator and the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the requirement was based.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;546. Renewal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement of proceedings; public notice and participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A franchising authority may, on its own initiative during the 6-month period which begins with the 36th month before the franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of (A) identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests, and (B) reviewing the performance of the cable operator under the franchise during the then current franchise term. If the cable operator submits, during such 6-month period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such a proceeding, the franchising authority shall commence such a proceeding not later than 6 months after the date such notice is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The cable operator may not invoke the renewal procedures set forth in subsections (b) through (g) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such a proceeding is requested by the cable operator by timely submission of such notice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such a proceeding is commenced by the franchising authority on its own initiative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission of renewal proposals; contents; time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection (a), a cable operator seeking renewal of a franchise may, on its own initiative or at the request of a franchising authority, submit a proposal for renewal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to section 544 of this title, any such proposal shall contain such material as the franchising authority may require, including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The franchising authority may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice of proposal; renewal; preliminary assessment of nonrenewal; administrative review; issues; notice and opportunity for hearing; transcript; written decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon submittal by a cable operator of a proposal to the franchising authority for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to subsection (b), the franchising authority shall provide prompt public notice of such proposal and, during the 4-month period which begins on the date of the submission of the cable operator's proposal pursuant to subsection (b), renew the franchise or, issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the operator or on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding, after providing prompt public notice of such proceeding, in accordance with paragraph (2) to consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cable operator has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of the operator's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in light of community needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the operator's proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any proceeding under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall be afforded adequate notice and the cable operator and the franchise authority, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection (a)), to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the completion of a proceeding under this subsection, the franchising authority shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the cable operator. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis for denial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with subsection (b) shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1), pursuant to the record of the proceeding under subsection (c). A franchising authority may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (c)(1)(A) or on events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) in any case in which a violation of the franchise or the events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) occur after the effective date of this subchapter unless the franchising authority has provided the operator with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the franchising authority has waived its right to object, or the cable operator gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the franchising authority fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial review; grounds for relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cable operator whose proposal for renewal has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority made pursuant to this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the franchising authority to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or failure pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any action of the franchising authority, other than harmless error, is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the event of a final decision of the franchising authority denying the renewal proposal, the operator has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the franchising authority with respect to each of the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the proceeding conducted under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Finality of administrative decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any decision of a franchising authority on a proposal for renewal shall not be considered final unless all administrative review by the State has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &quot;Franchise expiration&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;franchise expiration&quot; means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise, as provided under the franchise, as it was in effect on October 30, 1984.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Alternative renewal procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section, a cable operator may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to this subsection at any time, and a franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced). The provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal under this subsection. The denial of a renewal pursuant to this subsection shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is submitted in accordance with subsections (a) through (g).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Effect of renewal procedures upon action to revoke franchise for cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (h), any lawful action to revoke a cable operator's franchise for cause shall not be negated by the subsequent initiation of renewal proceedings by the cable operator under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity by increasing competition and diversity in the multichannel video programming market, to increase the availability of satellite cable programming and satellite broadcast programming to persons in rural and other areas not currently able to receive such programming, and to spur the development of communications technologies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for a cable operator, a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest, or a satellite broadcast programming vendor to engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the purpose or effect of which is to hinder significantly or to prevent any multichannel video programming distributor from providing satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Proceeding required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, in order to promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity by increasing competition and diversity in the multichannel video programming market and the continuing development of communications technologies, prescribe regulations to specify particular conduct that is prohibited by subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum contents of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations to be promulgated under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish effective safeguards to prevent a cable operator which has an attributable interest in a satellite cable programming vendor or a satellite broadcast programming vendor from unduly or improperly influencing the decision of such vendor to sell, or the prices, terms, and conditions of sale of, satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to any unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) prohibit discrimination by a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or by a satellite broadcast programming vendor in the prices, terms, and conditions of sale or delivery of satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming among or between cable systems, cable operators, or other multichannel video programming distributors, or their agents or buying groups; except that such a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or such a satellite broadcast programming vendor shall not be prohibited from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) imposing reasonable requirements for creditworthiness, offering of service, and financial stability and standards regarding character and technical quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) establishing different prices, terms, and conditions to take into account actual and reasonable differences in the cost of creation, sale, delivery, or transmission of satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) establishing different prices, terms, and conditions which take into account economies of scale, cost savings, or other direct and legitimate economic benefits reasonably attributable to the number of subscribers served by the distributor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) entering into an exclusive contract that is permitted under subparagraph (D);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) prohibit practices, understandings, arrangements, and activities, including exclusive contracts for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between a cable operator and a satellite cable programming vendor or satellite broadcast programming vendor, that prevent a multichannel video programming distributor from obtaining such programming from any satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or any satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest for distribution to persons in areas not served by a cable operator as of October 5, 1992; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) with respect to distribution to persons in areas served by a cable operator, prohibit exclusive contracts for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between a cable operator and a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or a satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest, unless the Commission determines (in accordance with paragraph (4)) that such contract is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Geographic limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this section shall require any person who is engaged in the national or regional distribution of video programming to make such programming available in any geographic area beyond which such programming has been authorized or licensed for distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Applicability to satellite retransmissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this section shall apply (i) to the signal of any broadcast affiliate of a national television network or other television signal that is retransmitted by satellite but that is not satellite broadcast programming, or (ii) to any internal satellite communication of any broadcast network or cable network that is not satellite broadcast programming.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Public interest determinations on exclusive contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether an exclusive contract is in the public interest for purposes of paragraph (2)(D), the Commission shall consider each of the following factors with respect to the effect of such contract on the distribution of video programming in areas that are served by a cable operator:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the effect of such exclusive contract on the development of competition in local and national multichannel video programming distribution markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the effect of such exclusive contract on competition from multichannel video programming distribution technologies other than cable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the effect of such exclusive contract on the attraction of capital investment in the production and distribution of new satellite cable programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the effect of such exclusive contract on diversity of programming in the multichannel video programming distribution market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the duration of the exclusive contract.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Sunset provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The prohibition required by paragraph (2)(D) shall cease to be effective 10 years after October 5, 1992, unless the Commission finds, in a proceeding conducted during the last year of such 10-year period, that such prohibition continues to be necessary to preserve and protect competition and diversity in the distribution of video programming.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjudicatory proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any multichannel video programming distributor aggrieved by conduct that it alleges constitutes a violation of subsection (b), or the regulations of the Commission under subsection (c), may commence an adjudicatory proceeding at the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Remedies for violations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Remedies authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon completion of such adjudicatory proceeding, the Commission shall have the power to order appropriate remedies, including, if necessary, the power to establish prices, terms, and conditions of sale of programming to the aggrieved multichannel video programming distributor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The remedies provided in paragraph (1) are in addition to and not in lieu of the remedies available under subchapter V or any other provision of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall prescribe regulations to implement this section. The Commission's regulations shall&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commercial consumer availability of equipment used to access services provided by multichannel video programming distributors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, in consultation with appropriate industry standard-setting organizations, adopt regulations to assure the commercial availability, to consumers of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel video programming distributor. Such regulations shall not prohibit any multichannel video programming distributor from also offering converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, to consumers, if the system operator's charges to consumers for such devices and equipment are separately stated and not subsidized by charges for any such service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall waive a regulation adopted under subsection (a) for a limited time upon an appropriate showing by a provider of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, or an equipment provider, that such waiver is necessary to assist the development or introduction of a new or improved multichannel video programming or other service offered over multichannel video programming systems, technology, or products. Upon an appropriate showing, the Commission shall grant any such waiver request within 90 days of any application filed under this subsection, and such waiver shall be effective for all service providers and products in that category and for all providers of services and products.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;554. Equal employment opportunity</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entities within scope of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to any corporation, partnership, association, joint-stock company, or trust engaged primarily in the management or operation of any cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discrimination prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Equal opportunity in employment shall be afforded by each entity specified in subsection (a), and no person shall be discriminated against in employment by such entity because of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Equal opportunity programs; establishment; maintenance; execution; terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any entity specified in subsection (a) shall establish, maintain, and execute a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to ensure equal opportunity in every aspect of its employment policies and practices. Under the terms of its program, each such entity shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) define the responsibility of each level of management to ensure a positive application and vigorous enforcement of its policy of equal opportunity, and establish a procedure to review and control managerial and supervisory performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inform its employees and recognized employee organizations of the equal employment opportunity policy and program and enlist their cooperation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) communicate its equal employment opportunity policy and program and its employment needs to sources of qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex, and solicit their recruitment assistance on a continuing basis;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Revision of rules; required provisions; annual statistical report; notice and comment on amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, and after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall prescribe revisions in the rules under this section in order to implement the amendments made to this section by such Act. Such revisions shall be designed to promote equality of employment opportunities for females and minorities in each of the job categories itemized in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such rules shall specify the terms under which an entity specified in subsection (a) shall, to the extent possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) disseminate its equal opportunity program to job applicants, employees, and those with whom it regularly does business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) use minority organizations, organizations for women, media, educational institutions, and other potential sources of minority and female applicants, to supply referrals whenever jobs are available in its operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) evaluate its employment profile and job turnover against the availability of minorities and women in its franchise area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) undertake to offer promotions of minorities and women to positions of greater responsibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) encourage minority and female entrepreneurs to conduct business with all parts of its operation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) analyze the results of its efforts to recruit, hire, promote, and use the services of minorities and women and explain any difficulties encountered in implementing its equal employment opportunity program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Such rules also shall require an entity specified in subsection (a) with more than 5 full-time employees to file with the Commission an annual statistical report identifying by race, sex, and job title the number of employees in each of the following full-time and part-time job categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Corporate officers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xi) Office and Clerical Personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xii) Skilled Craftspersons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xiii) Semiskilled Operatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xiv) Unskilled Laborers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xv) Service Workers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The report required by subparagraph (A) shall be made on separate forms, provided by the Commission, for full-time and part-time employees. The Commission's rules shall sufficiently define the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (vi) of such subparagraph so as to ensure that only employees who are principal decisionmakers and who have supervisory authority are reported for such categories. The Commission shall adopt rules that define the job categories listed in clauses (vii) through (xv) in a manner that is consistent with the Commission policies in effect on June 1, 1990. The Commission shall prescribe the method by which entities shall be required to compute and report the number of minorities and women in the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (x) and the number of minorities and women in the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (xv) in proportion to the total number of qualified minorities and women in the relevant labor market. The report shall include information on hiring, promotion, and recruitment practices necessary for the Commission to evaluate the efforts of entities to comply with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. The report shall be available for public inspection at the entity's central location and at every location where 5 or more full-time employees are regularly assigned to work. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the Commission from collecting or continuing to collect statistical or other employment information in a manner that it deems appropriate to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission may amend such rules from time to time to the extent necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Any such amendment shall be made after notice and opportunity for comment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Annual certification of compliance; periodic investigation of employment practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On an annual basis, the Commission shall certify each entity described in subsection (a) as in compliance with this section if, on the basis of information in the possession of the Commission, including the report filed pursuant to subsection (d)(3), such entity was in compliance, during the annual period involved, with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, periodically but not less frequently than every five years, investigate the employment practices of each entity described in subsection (a), in the aggregate, as well as in individual job categories, and determine whether such entity is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), including whether such entity's employment practices deny or abridge women and minorities equal employment opportunities. As part of such investigation, the Commission shall review whether the entity's reports filed pursuant to subsection (d)(3) accurately reflect employee responsibilities in the reported job classifications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Substantial failure to comply; penalties; notice to public and franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission finds after notice and hearing that the entity involved has willfully or repeatedly without good cause failed to comply with the requirements of this section, such failure shall constitute a substantial failure to comply with this subchapter. The failure to obtain certification under subsection (e) shall not itself constitute the basis for a determination of substantial failure to comply with this title. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &quot;repeatedly&quot;, when used with respect to failures to comply, refers to 3 or more failures during any 7-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who is determined by the Commission, through an investigation pursuant to subsection (e) or otherwise, to have failed to meet or failed to make best efforts to meet the requirements of this section, or rules under this section, shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty of $500 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. Any entity defined in subsection (a) shall not be liable for more than 180 days of forfeitures which accrued prior to notification by the Commission of a potential violation. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the forfeiture imposed on any person as a result of any violation that continues subsequent to such notification. In addition, any person liable for such penalty may also have any license under this chapter for cable auxiliary relay service suspended until the Commission determines that the failure involved has been corrected. Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or submits documentation which he knows to be false, pursuant to an application for certification under this section shall be in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4), and the last 2 sentences of paragraph (2), of section 503(b) of this title shall apply to forfeitures under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall provide for notice to the public and appropriate franchising authorities of any penalty imposed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Discrimination complaints; investigation; enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Employees or applicants for employment who believe they have been discriminated against in violation of the requirements of this section, or rules under this section, or any other interested person, may file a complaint with the Commission. A complaint by any such person shall be in writing, and shall be signed and sworn to by that person. The regulations under subsection (d)(1) shall specify a program, under authorities otherwise available to the Commission, for the investigation of complaints and violations, and for the enforcement of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &quot;Cable operator&quot; defined; owners of multiple unit dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the term &quot;cable operator&quot; includes any operator of any satellite master antenna television system, including a system described in section 522(7)(A) of this title and any multichannel video programming distributor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such term does not include any operator of a system which, in the aggregate, serves fewer than 50 subscribers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which a cable operator is the owner of a multiple unit dwelling, the requirements of this section shall only apply to such cable operator with respect to its employees who are primarily engaged in cable telecommunications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Regulatory powers of States and franchising authorities; nonexclusive nature of remedies and enforcement provisions; covered franchises</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of any State or any franchising authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to establish or enforce any requirement which is consistent with the requirements of this section, including any requirement which affords equal employment opportunity protection for employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to establish or enforce any provision requiring or encouraging any cable operator to conduct business with enterprises which are owned or controlled by members of minority groups (as defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title) or which have their principal operations located within the community served by the cable operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to enforce any requirement of a franchise in effect on the effective date of this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The remedies and enforcement provisions of this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, those available under this or any other law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this section shall apply to any cable operator, whether operating pursuant to a franchise granted before, on, or after October 30, 1984.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Open video systems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Certificates of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local exchange carrier may provide cable service to its cable service subscribers in its telephone service area through an open video system that complies with this section. To the extent permitted by such regulations as the Commission may prescribe consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, an operator of a cable system or any other person may provide video programming through an open video system that complies with this section. An operator of an open video system shall qualify for reduced regulatory burdens under subsection (c) of this section if the operator of such system certifies to the Commission that such carrier complies with the Commission's regulations under subsection (b) and the Commission approves such certification. The Commission shall publish notice of the receipt of any such certification and shall act to approve or disapprove any such certification within 10 days after receipt of such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dispute resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall have the authority to resolve disputes under this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder. Any such dispute shall be resolved within 180 days after notice of such dispute is submitted to the Commission. At that time or subsequently in a separate damages proceeding, the Commission may, in the case of any violation of this section, require carriage, award damages to any person denied carriage, or any combination of such sanctions. Any aggrieved party may seek any other remedy available under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commission actions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regulations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall complete all actions necessary (including any reconsideration) to prescribe regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as required pursuant to section 531, 534, or 535 of this title, prohibit an operator of an open video system from discriminating among video programming providers with regard to carriage on its open video system, and ensure that the rates, terms, and conditions for such carriage are just and reasonable, and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if demand exceeds the channel capacity of the open video system, prohibit an operator of an open video system and its affiliates from selecting the video programming services for carriage on more than one-third of the activated channel capacity on such system, but nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the number of channels that the carrier and its affiliates may offer to provide directly to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) permit an operator of an open video system to carry on only one channel any video programming service that is offered by more than one video programming provider (including the local exchange carrier's video programming affiliate): <i>Provided</i>, That subscribers have ready and immediate access to any such video programming service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) extend to the distribution of video programming over open video systems the Commission's regulations concerning sports exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.67), network nonduplication (47 C.F.R. 76.92 et seq.), and syndicated exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.151 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E)(i) prohibit an operator of an open video system from unreasonably discriminating in favor of the operator or its affiliates with regard to material or information (including advertising) provided by the operator to subscribers for the purposes of selecting programming on the open video system, or in the way such material or information is presented to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) require an operator of an open video system to ensure that video programming providers or copyright holders (or both) are able suitably and uniquely to identify their programming services to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if such identification is transmitted as part of the programming signal, require the carrier to transmit such identification without change or alteration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) prohibit an operator of an open video system from omitting television broadcast stations or other unaffiliated video programming services carried on such system from any navigational device, guide, or menu.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consumer access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) and the regulations thereunder, nothing in this section prohibits a common carrier or its affiliate from negotiating mutually agreeable terms and conditions with over-the-air broadcast stations and other unaffiliated video programming providers to allow consumer access to their signals on any level or screen of any gateway, menu, or other program guide, whether provided by the carrier or its affiliate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduced regulatory burdens for open video systems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any provision that applies to a cable operator under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sections 533 (other than subsection (a) thereof), 536, 543(f), 548, 551, and 554 of this title, shall apply,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) sections 531, 534, and 535 of this title, and section 325 of this title, shall apply in accordance with the regulations prescribed under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sections 532 and 537 of this title, and parts III and IV of this subchapter (other than sections 543(f), 548, 551, and 554 of this title), shall not apply,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">to any operator of an open video system for which the Commission has approved a certification under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the rulemaking proceeding to prescribe the regulations required by subsection (b)(1), the Commission shall, to the extent possible, impose obligations that are no greater or lesser than the obligations contained in the provisions described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection. The Commission shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) to prescribe such regulations no later than 6 months after February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An operator of an open video system under this part may be subject to the payment of fees on the gross revenues of the operator for the provision of cable service imposed by a local franchising authority or other governmental entity, in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under section 542 of this title. The rate at which such fees are imposed shall not exceed the rate at which franchise fees are imposed on any cable operator transmitting video programming in the franchise area, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission. An operator of an open video system may designate that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the fee under this subparagraph as a separate item on the bill.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulatory streamlining</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the establishment and operation of an open video system, the requirements of this section shall apply in lieu of, and not in addition to, the requirements of subchapter II.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment as cable operator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this chapter precludes a video programming provider making use of an open video system from being treated as an operator of a cable system for purposes of section 111 of title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &quot;Telephone service area&quot; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &quot;telephone service area&quot; when used in connection with a common carrier subject in whole or in part to subchapter II of this chapter means the area within which such carrier is offering telephone exchange service.</p>

The order shall include a determination whether any violation occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If the Commission determines that a violation has occurred, the Commission may, in the order issued under this subparagraph or in a subsequent order, direct the manufacturer or service provider to bring the service, or in the case of a manufacturer, the next generation of the equipment or device, into compliance with requirements of those sections within a reasonable time established by the Commission in its order.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Recordkeeping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Beginning one year after the effective date of regulations promulgated pursuant to section 617(e) of this title, each manufacturer and provider subject to sections 255, 617, and 619 of this title shall maintain, in the ordinary course of business and for a reasonable period, records of the efforts taken by such manufacturer or provider to implement sections 255, 617, and 619 of this title, including the following:</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Licensing for separated entities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Competition test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may not issue a license or construction permit to any separated entity, or renew or permit the assignment or use of any such license or permit, or authorize the use by any entity subject to United States jurisdiction of any space segment owned, leased, or operated by any separated entity, unless the Commission determines that such issuance, renewal, assignment, or use will not harm competition in the telecommunications market of the United States. If the Commission does not make such a determination, it shall deny or revoke authority to use space segment owned, leased, or operated by the separated entity to provide services to, from, or within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Criteria for competition test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763 and 763b&#160;<sup><a href="#761_1_target" name="761_1">1</a></sup> of this title, and shall not make such a determination unless the Commission determines that the privatization of any separated entity is consistent with such criteria.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Licensing for INTELSAT, Inmarsat, and successor entities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Competition test</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In considering the application of INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities for a license or construction permit, or for the renewal or assignment or use of any such license or permit, or in considering the request of any entity subject to United States jurisdiction for authorization to use any space segment owned, leased, or operated by INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities, to provide non-core services to, from, or within the United States, the Commission shall determine whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after April 1, 2001, in the case of INTELSAT and its successor entities, INTELSAT and any successor entities have been privatized in a manner that will harm competition in the telecommunications markets of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after April 1, 2000, in the case of Inmarsat and its successor entities, Inmarsat and any successor entities have been privatized in a manner that will harm competition in the telecommunications markets of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consequences of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission determines that such competition will be harmed or that grant of such application or request for authority is not otherwise in the public interest, the Commission shall limit through conditions or deny such application or request, and limit or revoke previous authorizations to provide non-core services to, from, or within the United States. After due notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall apply the same limitations, restrictions, and conditions to all entities subject to United States jurisdiction using space segment owned, leased, or operated by INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) National security, law enforcement, and public safety</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall not impose any limitation, condition, or restriction under subparagraph (B) in a manner that will, or is reasonably likely to, result in limitation, denial, or revocation of authority for non-core services that are used by and required for a national security agency or law enforcement department or agency of the United States, or used by and required for, and otherwise in the public interest, any other Department or Agency of the United States to protect the health and safety of the public. Such services may be obtained by the United States directly from INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or a successor entity, or indirectly through COMSAT, or authorized carriers or distributors of the successor entity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude the Commission from acting upon applications of INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities prior to the latest date set out in section 763(5)(A) of this title, including such actions as may be necessary for the United States to become the licensing jurisdiction for INTELSAT, but the Commission shall condition a grant of authority pursuant to this subsection upon compliance with sections 763 and 763a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Criteria for competition test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763, 763a, and 763c&#160;<sup><a href="#761_1_target" name="761_1">1</a></sup> of this title, and shall determine that competition in the telecommunications markets of the United States will be harmed unless the Commission finds that the privatization referred to in paragraph (1) is consistent with such criteria.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Clarification: competitive safeguards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making its licensing decisions under this subsection, the Commission shall consider whether users of non-core services provided by INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated entities are able to obtain non-core services from providers offering services other than through INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated entities, at competitive rates, terms, or conditions. Such consideration shall also include whether such licensing decisions would require users to replace equipment at substantial costs prior to the termination of its design life. In making its licensing decisions, the Commission shall also consider whether competitive alternatives in individual markets do not exist because they have been foreclosed due to anticompetitive actions undertaken by or resulting from the INTELSAT or Inmarsat systems. Such licensing decisions shall be made in a manner which facilitates achieving the purposes and goals in this subchapter and shall be subject to notice and comment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional considerations in determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making its determinations and licensing decisions under subsections (a) and (b), the Commission shall construe such subsections in a manner consistent with the United States obligations and commitments for satellite services under the Fourth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Independent facilities competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed as precluding COMSAT from investing in or owning satellites or other facilities independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or separated entities, or from providing services through reselling capacity over the facilities of satellite systems independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or separated entities. This subsection shall not be construed as restricting the types of contracts which can be executed or services which may be provided by COMSAT over the independent satellites or facilities described in this subsection.</p>

In securing such privatizations, the following criteria shall be applied as licensing criteria for purposes of part A:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Dates for privatization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Privatization shall be obtained in accordance with the criteria of this subchapter of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) INTELSAT as soon as practicable, but no later than April 1, 2001; and</p>

Such offering shall substantially dilute the aggregate ownership of such entities by such signatories or former signatories. In determining whether a public offering attains such substantial dilution, the Commission shall take into account the purposes and intent, privatization criteria, and other provisions of this subchapter, as well as market conditions. No intergovernmental organization, including INTELSAT or Inmarsat, shall have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an ownership interest in INTELSAT or the successor or separated entities of INTELSAT; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more than minimal ownership interest in Inmarsat or the successor or separated entities of Inmarsat.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) preferential access to orbital locations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Access to new, or renewal of access to, orbital locations shall be subject to the legal or regulatory processes of a national government that applies due diligence requirements intended to prevent the warehousing of orbital locations.</p>

No member of the board of directors of any successor or separated entity shall be a director, employee, officer or manager of any intergovernmental organization remaining after the privatization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any successor entity or separated entity shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have a board of directors with a fiduciary obligation;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Developing a Sustainable Spectrum Strategy for America's Future</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 25, 2018, 83 F.R. 54513, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. It is the policy of the United States to use radiofrequency spectrum (spectrum) as efficiently and effectively as possible to help meet our economic, national security, science, safety, and other Federal mission goals now and in the future. To best achieve this policy, the Nation requires a balanced, forward-looking, flexible, and sustainable approach to spectrum management.</p>
<p class="note-body">The growth in the availability of mobile wireless broadband connectivity over the past decade has reshaped the American experience&mdash;the way Americans work, learn, shop, run businesses, transport their families and goods across the Nation, farm, conduct financial transactions, consume entertainment, deliver and receive public safety services, and interact with one another. In the growing digital economy, wireless technologies expand opportunities to increase economic output of rural communities and connect them with urban markets, and offer safety benefits that save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce the cost of transportation incidents. American companies and institutions rely heavily on high-speed wireless connections, with increasing demands on both speed and capacity. Wireless technologies are helping to bring broadband to rural, unserved, and underserved parts of America. Spectrum-dependent systems also are indispensable to the performance of many important United States Government missions. And as a Nation, our dependence on these airwaves is likely to continue to grow.</p>
<p class="note-body">As the National Security Strategy of 2017 made clear, access to spectrum is a critical component of the technological capabilities that enable economic activity and protect national security. Wireless communications and associated data applications establish a foundation for high-wage jobs and national prosperity. While American industry continues to extract greater and greater value from spectrum, each technological leap also increases demands on its usage. Those demands have never been greater than today, with the advent of autonomous vehicles and precision agriculture, the expansion of commercial space operations, and the burgeoning Internet of Things signaling a nearly insatiable demand for spectrum access. Moreover, it is imperative that America be first in fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies&mdash;wireless technologies capable of meeting the high-capacity, low-latency, and high-speed requirements that can unleash innovation broadly across diverse sectors of the economy and the public sector. Flexible, predictable spectrum access by the United States Government will help ensure that Federal users can meet current and future mission requirements for a broad range of both communications- and non-communications-based systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Nation can and will ensure security and safety through modern technology. America's national security depends on technological excellence and the United States Government must continue to have access to the spectrum resources needed to serve the national interest, from protecting the homeland and managing the national airspace, to forecasting severe weather and exploring the frontiers of space. Technological innovation in spectrum usage, moreover, occurs in both the private and public sectors. Federal agencies must thoughtfully consider whether and how their spectrum-dependent mission needs might be met more efficiently and effectively, including through new technology and ingenuity. The United States Government shall continue to look for additional opportunities to share spectrum among Federal and non-Federal entities. The United States Government shall also continue to encourage investment and adoption by Federal agencies of commercial, dual-use, or other advanced technologies that meet mission requirements, including 5G technologies. In doing so, we will take appropriate measures to sustain the radiofrequency environment in which critical United States infrastructure and space systems operate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Advancing the National Spectrum Strategy</i>. Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum [Oct. 25, 2018], and concurrent with development of the National Spectrum Strategy referred to in section 4 of this memorandum:</p>

In carrying out its coordination functions, the Spectrum Strategy Task Force shall consult with the FCC.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions of contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial registry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall not exercise any option periods under any contract between the NTIA and the initial registry to operate and maintain the United States country code Internet domain unless the initial registry agrees, during the 90-day period beginning upon December 4, 2002, to carry out, and to operate the new domain in accordance with, the requirements under subsection (c). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the initial registry of the United States country code Internet domain from participating in the NTIA's process for selecting a successor registry or to prevent the NTIA from awarding, to the initial registry, the contract to be successor registry subject to the requirements of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Successor registries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall not enter into any contract for operating and maintaining the United States country code Internet domain with any successor registry unless such registry enters into an agreement with the NTIA, during the 90-day period after selection of such registry, that provides for the registry to carry out, and the new domain to operate in accordance with, the requirements under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements of new domain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The registry and new domain shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Rules and procedures for enforcement and oversight that minimize the possibility that the new domain provides access to content that is not in accordance with the standards and requirements of the registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A process for removing from the new domain any content that is not in accordance with the standards and requirements of the registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A process to provide registrants to the new domain with an opportunity for a prompt, expeditious, and impartial dispute resolution process regarding any material of the registrant excluded from the new domain.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to prohibit two-way and multiuser interactive services in the new domain, unless the registrant certifies to the registrar that such service will be offered in compliance with the content standards established pursuant to paragraph (1) and is designed to reduce the risk of exploitation of minors using such two-way and multiuser interactive services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to prohibit hyperlinks in the new domain that take new domain users outside of the new domain.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Option periods for initial registry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The NTIA shall grant the initial registry the option periods available under the contract between the NTIA and the initial registry to operate and maintain the United States country code Internet domain if, and may not grant such option periods unless, the NTIA finds that the initial registry has satisfactorily performed its obligations under this Act and under the contract. Nothing in this section shall preempt or alter the NTIA's authority to terminate such contract for the operation of the United States country code Internet domain for cause or for convenience.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of registry and other entities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Suspension of new domain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the NTIA finds, pursuant to its own review or upon a good faith petition by the registry, that the new domain is not serving its intended purpose, the NTIA shall instruct the registry to suspend operation of the new domain until such time as the NTIA determines that the new domain can be operated as intended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Definitions</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;317, &sect;2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2766, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and entertaining opportunity for children to learn, grow, and develop educationally and intellectually;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies indicate that a significant portion of all material available on the Internet is related to pornography;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web for positive purposes, are often presented&mdash;either mistakenly or intentionally&mdash;with material that is inappropriate for their age, which can be extremely frustrating for children, parents, and educators;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate for them, including pornography, can distort the education and development of the Nation's youth and represents a serious harm to American families that can lead to a host of other problems for children, including inappropriate use of chat rooms, physical molestation, harassment, and legal and financial difficulties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth, frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are at greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solicitation on the Internet;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to 17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of unwanted sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the solicitations were reported to the police;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) children who come across illegal content should report it to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes against children;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports, including reports of child pornography, online enticement for sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and child prostitution;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) although the computer software and hardware industries, and other related industries, have developed innovative ways to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to minors through parental control protections and self-regulation, to date such efforts have not provided a national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide Web;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) the creation of a &apos;green-light&apos; area within the United States country code Internet domain, that will contain only content that is appropriate for children under the age of 13, is analogous to the creation of a children's section within a library and will promote the positive experiences of children and families in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first with the parent, the protection of the physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under section 901 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) to facilitate the creation of a second-level domain within the United States country code Internet domain for the location of material that is suitable for minors and not harmful to minors; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) to ensure that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration oversees the creation of such a second-level domain and ensures the effective and efficient establishment and operation of the new domain.&quot;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expansion to maximum capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the date described in paragraph (1), a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e), ensure that it can accommodate expeditiously any increase in the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that authorized agencies may seek to conduct and use, up to the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notices of increased maximum capacity requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall periodically publish in the Federal Register, after notice and comment, notice of any necessary increases in the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after notice of increased maximum capacity requirements is published under paragraph (1), or within such longer time period as the Attorney General may specify, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e), ensure that its systems are capable of expanding to the increased maximum capacity set forth in the notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Carrier statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements pursuant to subsection (a) or (c), a telecommunications carrier shall submit to the Attorney General a statement identifying any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity to accommodate simultaneously the number of interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement required for compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall review the statements submitted under subsection (d) and may, subject to the availability of appropriations, agree to reimburse a telecommunications carrier for costs directly associated with modifications to attain such capacity requirement that are determined to be reasonable in accordance with section 1008(e) of this title. Until the Attorney General agrees to reimburse such carrier for such modification, such carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with the capacity notices under subsection (a) or (c).</p>

While broadband infrastructure has been deployed in a vast majority of communities across the country, today too many areas still lack adequate access to this crucial resource. For these areas, decisions on access to Federal property and rights of way can be essential to the deployment of both wired and wireless broadband infrastructure. The Federal Government controls nearly 30 percent of all land in the United States, owns thousands of buildings, and provides substantial funding for State and local transportation infrastructure, creating significant opportunities for executive departments and agencies (agencies) to help expand broadband infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Broadband Deployment on Federal Property Working Group</i>. (a) In order to ensure a coordinated and consistent approach in implementing agency procedures, requirements, and policies related to access to Federal lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted highways, and tribal lands to advance broadband deployment, there is established a Broadband Deployment on Federal Property Working Group (Working Group), to be co-chaired by representatives designated by the Administrator of General Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security (Co-Chairs) from their respective agencies, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (Director) and in coordination with the Chief Performance Officer (CPO).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Working Group shall be composed of:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) a representative from each of the following agencies, and the Co-Chairs, all of which have significant ownership of, or responsibility for managing, Federal lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted highways, and tribal lands (Broadband Member Agencies):</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13821. Streamlining and Expediting Requests To Locate Broadband Facilities in Rural America</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13821, Jan. 8, 2018, 83 F.R. 1507, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote better access to broadband internet service in rural America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. Americans need access to reliable, affordable broadband internet service to succeed in today's information-driven, global economy. Currently, too many American citizens and businesses still lack access to this basic tool of modern economic connectivity. This problem is particularly acute in rural America, and it hinders the ability of rural American communities to increase economic prosperity; attract new businesses; enhance job growth; extend the reach of affordable, high-quality healthcare; enrich student learning with digital tools; and facilitate access to the digital marketplace.</p>
<p class="note-body">It shall therefore be the policy of the executive branch to use all viable tools to accelerate the deployment and adoption of affordable, reliable, modern high-speed broadband connectivity in rural America, including rural homes, farms, small businesses, manufacturing and production sites, tribal communities, transportation systems, and healthcare and education facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">To implement this policy and enable sustainable rural broadband infrastructure projects, executive departments and agencies (agencies) should seek to reduce barriers to capital investment, remove obstacles to broadband services, and more efficiently employ Government resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">Among other actions, the executive branch will continue its implementation of section 6409 of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112&ndash;96) [47 U.S.C. 1455] (&quot;section 6409&quot;), which requires, among other things, that the General Services Administration (GSA) develop a common form and master contract for wireless facility sitings on buildings and other property owned by the Federal Government. These documents enable the Federal Government to process wireless facility siting requests more efficiently and will also provide additional predictability regarding the availability of locations for asset installation to installers of wireless broadband facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Reviewing Requests to Locate Broadband Facilities on Federal Real Property</i>. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of General Services (Administrator), in coordination with the heads of Federal property managing agencies, shall evaluate the effectiveness of the GSA Common Form Application for use in streamlining and expediting the processing and review of requests to locate broadband facilities on Federal real property.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As part of this evaluation, the Administrator shall determine whether any revisions to the GSA Common Form Application are appropriate and, to the extent consistent with law, shall begin implementation of any such revisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In furtherance of section 6409, all applicants and Federal property managing agencies shall use the GSA Common Form Application for wireless service antenna structure siting developed by the Administrator for requests to locate broadband facilities on Federal property. Federal property managing agencies shall expeditiously review and approve such requests unless an approval would negatively affect performance of the agency's mission or otherwise not be in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, all Federal property managing agencies shall report to the GSA regarding their required use of the Common Form Application, the number of Common Form Applications received, the percentage approved, the percentage rejected, the basis for any rejection, and the number of working days each application was pending before being approved or rejected. Each report shall include the number of applications received, approved, and rejected within the preceding quarter.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Ninety days after the date of this order, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, the Administrator shall prepare and provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director) an aggregated summary report detailing results from the reports submitted under subsection (d) of this section. Not later than 1 year from the date of this order, the Administrator shall recommend to the Director improvements to the Common Form Application needed to further the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Definitions</i>. As used in this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &quot;Federal property managing agencies&quot; means agencies that have custody and control of, or responsibility for managing, Federal lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted highways, and tribal lands.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The term &quot;Federal real property&quot; has the same meaning as that term has in Executive Order 13327 of February 4, 2004 (Federal Real Property Asset Management) [40 U.S.C. 121 note].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the functions of the Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than December 31, 2022, the Secretary, working through the NTIA, and the Commission shall identify a total of at least 255 megahertz of Federal and non-Federal spectrum for mobile and fixed wireless broadband use.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any spectrum that has been made available for licensed or unlicensed use on and after February 11, 2016, and that otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section may be counted towards the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Relocation prioritized over sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall be carried out in accordance with section 923(j) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to require the disclosure of classified information, law enforcement sensitive information, or other information that must be protected in the interest of national security; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to affect any requirement under section 156 of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 921 note), as added by section 1062(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, or any other relevant statutory requirement applicable to the reallocation of Federal spectrum.</p>
